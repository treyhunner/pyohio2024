              - And that, counter-intuitively, **(CLICK)** spending a practice sessions bouncing between different topics is often a more effective learning strategy than dedicating a study session to just *one* topic
              - Also **(CLICK)** short *daily* study sessions are often more effective than longer *weekly* study sessions
              - And **(CLICK)** explaining an idea in your own words by making connections to existing knowledge is both helpful and fun

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
<span class="fragment bold">Explicit is better than implicit.</span>
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
<span class="fragment bold">Readability counts.</span>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</span>

            - Which of course **(CLICK)** is **another kind of cognitive bias**
            - ...
            - So try to *focus* on **recognizing your own** biases first
            - You **can't get rid** of your biases, but you *can* **try to respond to them**

            - As we've already seen, you can *append* a list **(CLICK)** *to itself* in Python
            - Python is smart enough **(CLICK)** to represent that list using 3 dots **(CLICK)** because otherwise it would need to show an **infinite number** of **square brackets**
            - Interestingly, that string representation is *also* valid Python code **(CLICK)**
            - Though it represents **(CLICK)** a list **containing a list** containing Python's special `Ellipsis` object
            - Which is a bit odd

            - Every concept in our head has **some sort of mental model** attached to it
            - Our brain forms mental models **implicitly**
            - But it's often helpful to **make our models more explicit**
            - Deliberately considering our models can **help us discover** where our models of the world **break down** and where they don't

            - First, let's try to mentally model variables as **(CLICK)** buckets that contain objects

            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, **(CLICK)** the list is **copied** into a new bucket **(CLICK)**
            - Let's say we then append `9` to that first list **(CLICK)**, which would **(CLICK)** mutate the first list
            - But the second list shouldn't change... **(CLICK)**
            - ... Except it *does* **(CLICK)** change!
            - This mental model **(CLICK)** doesn't work... at least not in Python
            - Variables in Python are *not* like **buckets that contain objects**

            - Let's mentally model variables as **(CLICK)** sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list **(CLICK)**, we attach that variable name to the object **(CLICK)**
            - Then when we assign **(CLICK)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(CLICK)** attach **another name** to the *same* object
            - So when we change **(CLICK)** that first list, the first one changes **(CLICK)** but the second one changes also **(CLICK)**... because it's all just one list

            - Let's mentally model variables as references **(CLICK)** or pointers
            - We have two worlds: **(CLICK)** variable land and **(CLICK)** object land
            - Variables live in **variable land** and they *point* to objects that live in **object land**
            - So when we **(CLICK)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(CLICK)** that variable to that new list object
            - Then when we assign **(CLICK)** another variable to the first one, we point **(CLICK)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(CLICK)** modify the first list **(CLICK)**...
            - The first list changes **(CLICK)** and so does the second **(CLICK)** because *they're the same list*
            - But wait... why does our list have an **arrow pointing to an integer**?
            - Well, just as **variables don't contain objects**, objects *also* don't contain objects
            - Objects can only *point* to objects, so the list's index `0` **(CLICK)** points to the integer `9` **(CLICK)**
            - That's also why...

            - ... if we **(CLICK)** put our list inside another list, we'll be **(CLICK)** pointing one of the indexes in that **new list** to *our* **existing** list
            - Variables **can point** to objects and objects *can point* to **other objects**.
            - Nothing **ever** points to variables.
            - Variables are just a name that references an object

            - This third mental model *is* a bit more **complex** than the sticky note model, but it **stretches** a bit further
            - The **indirection** between variables and objects **is tricky**, but it also makes it easier to understand how **data structures** work.
            - I'd argue that, of these 3 mental models, *this* one is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects

            - Linguistic determinism **(CLICK)** is the idea that our thoughts are **constrained** by the language we use. We can't think thoughts that we don't have words for.
            - This is *not* a real thing. **(CLICK)** It *is* **possible** to think thoughts that we have no words for.
            - Linguistic relativism **(CLICK)** is the idea that our language **doesn't determine** our thoughts, but it does *affect* them

            - There is **an interaction** I've had **repeatedly** over the years:
            - A Python learner will tell me that they've **(CLICK)** assigned two variables (`first` and `second`) to the same value and then they'll say **(CLICK)** "when I change `first`, it **doesn't *always* change `second`**"
            - When I ask what they mean, inevitably they'll show me something like this...
            - "here I changed first" **(CLICK)** "and second changed" **(CLICK)**
            - But "*here* when I change first" **(CLICK)**... "second doesn't change" **(CLICK)**
            - Why?
            - The word "change" **(CLICK)** is the problem here.
            - "change" is accidentally playing two different roles

            - So instead of using the word "change" **(CLICK)** I encourage folks learning with me to be more explicit **(CLICK)**
            - ... as the Zen of Python says: explicit is better than implicit
            - When we **(CLICK)** reassign first, second still points to the same object
            - But if we instead **(CLICK)** mutate the object that first points to, if second **points to the same object**, then **both first and second** will *see* that change
            - The word change can be **ambiguous** in Python... and ambiguity can reinforce **fuzzy and incorrect mental models**
            - Just to drive home these two types of change, let's try to use that third mental model again...

            - For the sake of simplicity, I've **removed the extra arrows** that would normally be pointing from **each index in our list** to **separate integer objects**
            - Integers are **immutable in Python** so this simplification *shouldn't* get us in trouble
            - So... we've assigned `second` to `first` which means both variables now point to **the same** 4-item list
            - When we **append** to `first` **(CLICK)**, the list changes **(CLICK)**
            - When we look at `second`, **(CLICK)** we'll see that it changed because it **points to the same list**
            - But if we **reassign** `first`, **(CLICK)** we're **pointing that variable** to a *new* list **(CLICK)**
            - Which means `second` is unchanged **(CLICK)**
            - The `second` variable still points to the **original list**, which hasn't been touched
            - This is why the word "change" is ambiguous: mutations change objects and assignments change **which object** a *variable* points to

            - Over the years, I've gradually became more careful about my word choice
            - While teaching, **(CLICK)** I used to use phrases like "`colors` contains a list" **(CLICK)**
            - Or... "`colors` is a list" **(CLICK)**
            - But I found that using these phrases sometimes caused confusion **(CLICK)**, especially when I tried to teach **how variables actually work** in Python
            - Now I usually use the phrase "points to" **(CLICK)**
            - colors *points to* a list
            - This phrase doesn't hint at an incorrect mental model **(CLICK)**
            - And while the word "pointer" is a **technical term** that's not *usually* used in Python, it's also a term that **evokes an idea** that we're **familiar** with **(CLICK)**
            - **Brand new** programmers *and* senior developers both seem to understand this phrase...
            - They may not yet understand the mental model **I'm implying** *with* it, but at least **I haven't caused confusion** by **hinting** at an **incorrect** mental model

            - There wasn't any official contact information to use for reporting issues for the next 3 years **(CLICK)**
            - And there wasn't a group of individuals dedicated to handling CoC issues until the CoC work group was formed a year later **(CLICK)**
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about **10 sentences long** and those of us *in* this new workgroup soon realized that it wasn't actually **enforceable**...
            - Until it was **rewritten** a couple years later...**(CLICK)**
            - Today the PSF has an **actionable** Code of Conduct with **publicly documented** processes around **reporting** and **enforcement** and Code of Conduct issues are handled by a **dedicated group of volunteers**
            - But before 2019, the process for addressing code of conduct issues within certain PSF spaces was **(CLICK)** ...**unspecified**...
            - ...It's sometimes hard not to get discouraged by an exceptionally imperfect situation...

            - interleaved practice **(CLICK)** involves jumping **back and forth** between *multiple* topics within a *single* practice session
            - **(CLICK)** Many traditional forms of teaching either explicitly or implicitly **encourage blocked practice**
            - ... even though blocked practice is **less effective** than interleaved practice
            - After learning that interleaved practice was more effective, I wished that **(CLICK)** I could *immediately* change all of my curriculum...
            - but I had team trainings coming up and **not a lot of time** to change everything

            - Of course... there was actually a third option that was **more challenging** for me to accept...
            - I could both **(CLICK)** appreciate what I had so far *and* gradually update my curriculum...
            - to bring it closer to the ideal curriculum that I *imagine* **might one day exist**
            - I am *still* working toward that **ideal version** of my curriculum.
            - My teaching materials are **better than they were**, but they're not *yet* where I want them to be.

            - Python Morsels is a service to help working Python developers level-up their skills by solving a **real-word Python exercise** every week

            - It started **(CLICK)** as a paid email list in February of 2018
            - For the first 6 months of its existence, there was **no web app**
            - The website was just a single page with a buy button
            - Of course, it didn't *really* start in February either.
            - I started **beta testing the exercises** for this service with a few friends in October of 2017. **(CLICK)**
            - Though even after the web app launched though... there was **(CLICK)** no way to **grade your work** and no way to **control how often** you received new exercise **(CLICK)**
            - Those features came *much* later
            - You've probably heard the phrase **(CLICK)** "minimum viable product"
            - When you're starting a new project, it's easiest to start with the *smallest* steps you *can* to **gather feedback**, and then **iterate**
