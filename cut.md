Where is your attention?

When learning something new, we often remember better when we take a guess and *then* reveal the answer.
Why? No one really knows, but "surprise" is a pretty good guess.
When we're surprised our brain pays more attention.

Early humans that paid to paid attention to surprises may have been less likely to be killed by predators.

Focus.
Ask questions.
Be curious.
Develop habits.
Seek advice.
Introspect.

These are all ways to catch our attention. Catching the attention of our brain is the first step toward progress.

Once an idea has your attention, you'll mull it over.
And thinking *about* an idea is the first step toward being able to *act* on that idea.

I think of System 1 as not just faster-thinking but also more implicit.

I think of System 2 as more explicit because it's a bit slower and more deliberate.

The Zen of Python says:
Explicit is better than implicit

So is System 2 *better* than System 1?
No, but also yes.

It's more powerful, but it's slower and it takes more energy.
Changing our conditioning to slow down and step into System 2 takes hard work... and that work isn't always worth it.

When my someone tells me "what you did hurt me", I feel two competing emotions.

I feel:

- Empathy: I know what being feels like
- Defensive: my actions and myself are being judged

My actions are being judged and I am being judged.

TODO my defensiveness is often stronger, especially when the hurt that was caused or my own sense of agency are big

A more real world example with the words and phrases we use.

"Light years" are *not* a measure of time

"Organic food" is a weird phrase because inorganic food doesn't exist. (a metal apple)

A "Calorie" in nutrition and a "calorie" in chemistry are not the same thing... but in a frustrating way.
1 capital-C "Calorie" is equal to 1,000 lowercase-c "calories".

"Biannually": twice each year or once every 2 years?

When I read "4 ounces"... are we talking about volume or weight?

"Serverless"... this word can mean a lot of things, but it rarely means "without a server"

"Theory of Relativity"
Once a theory becomes broadly accepted, it doesn't become a fact... it just stays in "theory" land forever.
The proper functioning of GPS satellites heavily depends of this so-called theory.

"Literally".
I literally do not understand what happened to this word.

"guys"

Our brains are very concerned with our perception of ourselves.

Am I smart?

Do I belong?

Am I good?

--Cognitive dissonance--

This is partly why cognitive dissonance can be so hard to grapple with.

When my actions don't align with what I think is good or correct, I feel unsettled.

---

Move vegan section out of default states, after progress, and after discomfort, to talk specifically about cognitive dissonance as a form of discomfort that I continue to sit with.

---

So in summary:

- Admit that you have a human brain
- Give your beliefs names and shapes
    - Naming things: give important ideas names
    - Mental models: make your mental models explicit
- Iterate, accepting discomfort
- Think outside yourself
    - Modeling your thinking 
    - There are levels to this
- Note opportunities for improvement

- Hold your identity lightly? - Julia Galef


---

I'm going to talk about:

- Naming Things
- Mental Models
- Iterating on Your Beliefs
- Cognitive Dissonance
- Admitting Your Flaws

That third idea might be a little uncomfortable, but it's the last two ideas that where I'll be hoping you don't throw vegetables at me.

You said something in a code review that your coworker was offended by.

How did they experience what you said as offensive?
What were you feeling when you said that?
Why did you feel that?
Why did you say what you did?
Was there another way you *could* have said what you did?

This sort of deliberate reflection takes energy and time.
It can also be emotionally taxing.

The goal isn't to do this for every negative interaction we have... the goal is to help us recognize a pattern so that we can occasionally slow down and act more deliberately until our new thinking patterns and actions become our new habit.

I teach Python to groups through team trainings and to individuals through Python Morsels.

I know that

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty clear cut trade-off, but often the balance is *not* so obvious... at least not at first.

As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

---

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

---

It's hard not to get wrapped up in your own self of `self`

Who are you?

Are you a good person or a bad person?

Are you think kind of person who would `____`?

Our identities are part of us.

---

As Julia Galef said in The Scout Mindset, thinking like a "scout" means holding your identity lightly.

It's not easy to avoid...

Identifying with the code we write

Identifying with the actions we perform

Identifying with the actions we *want to* perform

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

300 years from now, which of my actions will look absurd?

Which of my actions will look immoral or naive?

---

We mostly experience the world from a first-person perspective.

Attempting to seek out or model a third-person perspective can be very helpful when seeking a resolution to a conflict.

Taking on a second-person perspective is the hardest, that is thinking from the perspective of the person you're directly interacting with. Empathy.

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

Outline idea...

The story/journey of the talk
- This talk is about a recursive topic
- Thinking about your own thinking can make you a better software developer, a better teacher, a better learner, and a better person
- Think about thinking about thinking can help you
    - model other people's thoughts and feelings and understand the motivation behind their actions
    - understand the reasons behind your own actions
    - shape habits
    - learn
    - teach
    - empathize
    - be more compassionate
- our brain makes mental mental models... some mental models you can't really control, but some you can
- my students sometimes have trouble understanding how Python's variables work because it's easy to assume a mental model that doesn't match up with how Python actually works
- TODO need a story here maybe?
- Story about recording video and experiencing sunk cost bias
- Cognitive biases happen... we can't completely avoid them, but we can acknowledge them and try to work around them
- The next time I have an urge to edit a video, I think I might remember publicly admitting my own sunk cost bias on stage at PyOhio and *hopefully* I'll pause for a moment to seriously consider whether I should re-record my video instead of editing it
- So our brains form mental models about the world and use heuristics to patterns in the world... Both our mental models and our brain's mental heuristics can have bugs that bias toward making undesirable decisions
- This is both a part of being human and it's something that we can and *should* try to recognize and work around when possible
- But we also use language to communicate mental models to *others*...
- And sometimes we might accidentally *imply* a mental model that we didn't *mean* to
- TODO maybe shorten names and words section to ...
    - naming variables in your code is important for the sake of readability (as is using variable names instead of indexes)
    - it's hard for me to teach Python's many asterisk syntaxes because they lack clearly defined names that everyone agrees on... unlike the "walrus operator" which we all call "the walrus operator". It has a name, it looks like the name, and it's memorable.
    - name things, well
    - names paint mental models, both explicitly and implicitly
    - Years ago, while teaching I used to use phrases like "x contains a list" or "x is a list". I found that these phrases made it harder to explain the way Python's variables work.
    - There is a repeated interaction I've had over the years: "I changed x and y changed, but here when I change x, y doesn't change". The word "change" is the problem here. That word is accidentally playing two different roles... it's like the word biannually or "ounces"... are we talking weight or volume?
    - So instead of using the word "change", I encourage folks learning with me to be more explicit (as the Zen of Python says)
    - Note whether we're assigning (changing a variable) or mutating (changing an object)
    - The words we choose are important, especially when we use certain words and phrases habitually or when our words will be heard or read by many people
    - Thinking about the mental models behind your words can make you a better documenter, a better technical writing, and a better teacher
    - And more generally thinking about the words and phrases we use can make you a better coworker and a better friend (see Ned Batchelder's keynote on interpersonal interactions, April, and Jesse too?)
    - ...
- we've talked about how deliberately considering your mental models can improve your understanding of the world around you, how trying to recognize your cognitive biases can improve your decision-making abilities, and how considering the words we use is important for the sake of hinting at more accurate mental models and also to improve our interpersonal communications...
- Now let's talk about iterating (for loop)
    - But not that kind of iterating...
    - We're talking about making progress
    - PSF CoC
    - Years ago I read a book called "Make it Stick"... I've read many other books on learning since then, but that book happened to be my introduction to a number of important topics related to teaching and learning
    - There's one idea that stuck out to me in that book and both excited and upset me...
    - Blocked vs interleaved practice
    - My courses at the time were in such a way that when it came time to write code, we would write code that practiced one specific topic.
    - Based on what I'd learned, this fairly common teaching style sounded like blocked practice... but I'd just learned that this is inefficient
    - Bouncing between multiple topics is a *more efficient* way to learn than focusing on just one topic...
    - After this realization, I felt as if I had two choices...
    - ... I still haven't updated my curriculum to embraced interleaved practice as much as I'd like... I *have* made *some* progress though.
    - Don't be afraid to acknowledge that *you* are *your actions* are a work-in-progress, all the time. Being a work-in-progress means you're moving forward and that's excellent. Moving forward requires us to acknowledge that there's progress to be made.

- Focus on outcomes
    - Stop focusing on your moral worth. Try to maximize the good in the world.
    - Outcomes matter a lot more than intent
    - Selfish versus selfless doesn't matter nearly as much as maximizing outcomes
    - In 100 years, most likely no one will remember anything that any of us did... but we *can* leave the world a little bit better off in the process
- Admit fault
    - The unfortunate balance of ego:
        - Inflated self-worth: I am good, so if I did something bad there was a good reason.
        - Deflated self-worth: If I did a bad thing, that means I'm bad. I can't handle being bad.
    - A focus on "self" is a slipper slope toward not being able to handle the fact that you made a mistake
    - We all cause harm
        - You did someting that caused harm. Maybe it was a "bad" thing or maybe a "good" thing that had some sort of negative outcome.
        - Doing a "bad" thing or simply causing harm does not mean you're "bad".
        - Your moral worth doesn't matter... at least it doesn't matter to anyone else.
    - Apologizing is hard. It's a learned skill and it's not trivial.
- Work toward improvement
    - Improve your understanding of the world
    - Improve your understanding of yourself
    - Improve your understanding of others
    - Try to improve the world

Deontology is about "doing what's right"
"It's the thought that counts"
Consequentialism: doesn't matter what you do but what the result is
"The road to hell is paved with bad intentions"
Deontology has a clear right/wrong
Consequentialism leans toward accepting that we might weight things incorrectly

- It's mid-February 2020
- I had just finished a client training that involved me traveling through an airport full of international travelers and we were in a global pandemic and I was experiencing a mix of ignorance and denial about the state of my world
- After I traveled home for what I, didn't know at the time, would be my last flight of 2020... I listened to a podcast episode that had me thinking about morality and ethics
- After listening to that episode, and as the US was starting to lock down due to COVID-19, I started listening to an audiobook by the guest of that podcast episode
- This book had me considering very odd lines of thinking... at least odd for me at the time
    - I wondered whether I needed to donate much of my money to be a good person
    - and whether I have a moral obligation to donate one of my kidneys?
    - and whether my way of living was causing undue suffering in the world...
- I'd like to note... that I love food and I am a *somewhat* adventurous eater
- ...

Discomfort

Deliberate

Don't get me wrong...

I'm not advocating for discomfort for its own sake.

Don't stick your hand in a bucket of ice water for no good reason.

But TODO need a good analogy that involves slowing down and doing something a bit uncomfortable for the benefit of the whole and maybe even for our own benefit...?
