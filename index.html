            - I would have talked about...
              - How **(click)** we don't learn by putting information *into* our heads but by trying to retrieve information *from* our heads
              - We often overvalue books and videos and undervalue all forms of quizzing, including writing code
              - I also would have talked the fact that importance of **(click)** *deliberate* practice, meaning writing code for the *sake* of learning rather than for productivity's sake
              - And that, counter-intuitively, **(click)** spending a practice sessions bouncing between different topics is often a more effective learning strategy than dedicating a study session to just *one* topic
              - Also **(click)** short daily study sessions are often more effective than longer study sessions once a week
              - And **(click)** explaining an idea in your own words by making connections to existing knowledge is both helpful and fun
              - These are all important learning techniques...
              - But this talk is *not* about learning

            - Did you know that Python's strings **(click)** are an infinitely recursive data structure?

I'm talking about thinking about your own thinking and thinking about the thinking of others, both in a reflective way and in deliberate future-thinking way. Deliberacy and explicitness of thought. Explicit is better than implicit. -->

            - We could try to mentally model Python's variables and data structures as buckets that contain objects
            - If we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, that variable contains that list **(click)**
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, **(click)** the list is copied into a new bucket **(click)**
            - Let's say we then append `9` to that first list **(click)**, which would **(click)** mutate the first list
            - But the second list shouldn't change... **(click)**
            - ... Except it *does* **(click)** change!
            - This mental model **(click)** isn't going to work
            - Variables in Python are *not* like buckets that contain objects
            - Let's try another one...

            - Let's mentally model variables as sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, we attach that variable name to the object **(click)**
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(click)** attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change **(click)** that first list, the first one changes **(click)** but the second one changes also **(click)**... because it's all just one list

            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references or pointers
            - When we **(click)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(click)** that variable to the object
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we point **(click)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(click)** modify the first list **(click)**, the first list changes **(click)** and so does the second **(click)** because *they're the same list*
            - And if we **(click)** put our list inside another list, we'll simply be **(click)** pointing one of the indexes in that new list to *our* existing list
            - This mental model *is* a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it also makes it easier to understand how data structures work
            - I'd argue that this mental model is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects
            - But keep in mind that *every* mental model has its limits

            - This optical illusion relies on a mental model that our brain uses automatically

            - An anchoring bias occurs when our brains inadvertently anchor our thinking on a specific piece of information, which can sometimes cloud our judgement
            - For example, when Steve Jobs, announced the price of the iPad, **(click)** he displayed $999 on the screen for many seconds before eventually announcing that the price of an iPad would be $499 **(click)**
            - That made the iPads *immediately* seem inexpensive

            - We *cannot* possibly overcome all of our cognitive biases at all times. Most of our thinking involves mental shortcuts by necessity and shortcuts always have a risk an accidental bias.
            - In the book **(click)** Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman talks about **(click)** System 1 and **(click)** System 2, which...
            - (speaking of naming things)
            - are *awful* names
            - You can think of these as "fast thinking" **(click)** and "slow thinking" **(click)**
            - Fast thinking involves fast and nearly effortless mental work
            - Slow thinking involves slow and deliberate mental work
            - It might seem like slow thinking is better...
            - but slow thinking requires more energy and time than fast thinking and there's no way to force our brain to use it for all of our actions... and we wouldn't *really* want to
            - Fast thinking *is* absolutely necessary, though it's also the cause of many our cognitive biases

            - Words have 
            - When I'm teaching Python, I find that the phrases I use can **(click)** accidentally imply an incorrect mental model
            - Let's say **(click)** we've assigned a `colors` variable to a list of strings
            - So `colors` contains a list **(click)**
            - Except... it doesn't **(click)**
            - Because variables don't *contain* objects in Python
            - Okay... maybe we could say
            - `colors` *is* a list **(click)**
            - That's *better*, **(click)** but it sort of implies that there's a one-to-one relationship between our variable and the list.
            - ... which isn't the case
            - What if we said `colors` **(click)** *points to* a list?

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Sometimes confusion is hard to avoid
            - When I say "generator" I usually mean a "generator object"
            - Which the Python documentation calls a "generator iterator"
            - But the Python documentation defines a "generator" as a function with a `yield` statement in it...
            - But I always call that a "generator function"
            - And what I usually call "the REPL", is usually referred to in the official documentation as either "the interactive shell" or "the interactive interpreter"
            - TODO words matter only so much...
              - variables in Python aren't pointers because they can't be dereferenced
              - If someone says the phrase "generator comprehension", I know they mean "generator expression" and in fact every time I hear generator comprehension I *wish* that was the official term
              - The phrase "the `reversed` function" is technically incorrect because `reversed` is actually a class... but that phrase is also perfectly acceptable because we thanks to duck typing in Python, the word "function" is often used to mean "an object you can call" rather than an actual function object
              - The phrases `print` method and `print` statement are technically incorrect and I try to avoid those as a teacher, but I also try to only gently nudge my students toward talking about `print` as a function.
              - The term "argument" can be confusing... function argument, command-line argument, or are we talking about a variable name in a function definition... which is technically a parameter but the words "variable" or "argument" are often used instead
              - "We call the `append` function on the list" might paint a slightly different picture than "we call the `append` method on the list" even thuogh methods are technically functions

          <h2>Name Gratitudes</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - While I'm talking about names, I'd like to note some names that I'm grateful for
            - Truthiness: which is technically called "truth value testing", but no one usually says that
            - Duck typing: which describes the affinity we have in Python for object behaviors over object types
            - The walrus operator, which totally looks like a sideways walrus face `:=`
            - TODO
            - Which the Python documentation calls a "generator iterator"
            - But the Python documentation defines a "generator" as a function with a `yield` statement in it...
            - But I always call that a "generator function"
            - And what I usually call "the REPL", is usually referred to in the official documentation as either "the interactive shell" or "the interactive interpreter"
            - TODO words matter only so much...
              - variables in Python aren't pointers because they can't be dereferenced
              - If someone says the phrase "generator comprehension", I know they mean "generator expression" and in fact every time I hear generator comprehension I *wish* that was the official term
              - The phrase "the `reversed` function" is technically incorrect because `reversed` is actually a class... but that phrase is also perfectly acceptable because we thanks to duck typing in Python, the word "function" is often used to mean "an object you can call" rather than an actual function object
              - The phrases `print` method and `print` statement are technically incorrect and I try to avoid those as a teacher, but I also try to only gently nudge my students toward talking about `print` as a function.
              - The term "argument" can be confusing... function argument, command-line argument, or are we talking about a variable name in a function definition... which is technically a parameter but the words "variable" or "argument" are often used instead
              - "We call the `append` function on the list" might paint a slightly different picture than "we call the `append` method on the list" even thuogh methods are technically functions
              - Using phrases like instatiate, declare, etc... can be confusing
              - When we talk about a generator, do we mean a generator object or a generator function?

            - TODO fragments for this and next few slides
            - Many years ago, I was working on a Python project that needed to serialize JSON data.
            - Today, I would have solved my problem by using the `json` module in the Python standard library.
            - But at the time, we were using Python 2.4, which did not *have* a `json` module.
            - There was a third-party `simplejson` library, which later became the official `json` module.
            - But I chose not to use that.
            - Instead, I wrote my own JSON formatter.
            - Why did I do this?

            - Today, I think of "Not Invented" here as "Not Thought of By Me".
            - "Not Thought of By Me" is a bit broader...
            - Instead of asking your coworker to help you brainstorm a problem, you might try to solve everything on your own.
            - What if you don't have a coworker to ask?
            - Well, there's always a search engine.
            - And today, there's always a chat bot.
            - And yes, you should *not* assume a chat bot will give you the right answer, in full the first time you ask it a question.
            - But you also shouldn't assume that the code you found on StackOverflow is correct
            - And you should probably check to very that the third-party library you're using actually does what you *think* it does
            - You should verify that your solution actually works... but that doesn't mean you need to invent the solution yourself.

            - **(click)** There wasn't any official contact information to use use for reporting conduct issues in online PSF spaces for the next 3 years
            - And until a year after that, **(click)** there wasn't actually a group of individuals dedicated to handling Code of Conduct issues... everything was handled directly by the board of directors
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about 10 sentences long and it wasn't actually enforceable...

          But making progress often does involve periods of discomfort on entire seasons of discontent.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - In 2020, I listened to some podcast interviews that started me down a path of questioning some of my actions and my beliefs
            - I realized that I had (and *still* have) some implicit mental models that are both incomplete and inconsistent
            - I believed that **(click)** meat tastes really good
            - And **(click)** suffering is bad
            - Even if suffering experienced by animals is at least *a little bit* bad
            - These two ideas aren't *actually* contradictory... both of these statements are true

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - First I'll note that while *I am not a philosopher*, I did run this slide by a philosopher and she assured me that this is definitely an oversimplification but it's also "good enough" for a quick a summary
            - There are 2 primary moral frameworks that I've heard philosophers talk about
            - Deontology, **(click)** which is a belief that each action is either right or wrong and we should try to perform only right actions.
            - and Consequentialism, **(click)** which is a belief that actions should be judged based on their outcomes
            - Both of these moral frameworks have problems
            - Deontology focuses on the intent of an action and can lead to some black-and-white thinking
            - But consequentialism requires guessing about the outcomes of our actions and guesses are *bound* to be faulty
            - Problems aside, at heart, I am *mostly* a consequentialist
            - Meaning I believe that most of the time **(click)** we should try to weigh the good and the bad and maximize the outcome as best as we can
            - This *does* require guesswork... but I sincerely think the outcomes of an action are at least a bit more important than the intent behind the action

            - So back in 2020, I came to the conclusion that, the production of most pieces of meat involved suffering **(click)**
            - I can't say that I *didn't* know this before 2020, but I do know that I didn't think about very much
            - And I don't think I'm incredible at compartmentalizing, but even after I started thinking about this... **(click)**
            - I still found that meat tastes great
            - Which means **(click)** I'd need to take a guess at whether the enjoyment that each bite of meat brought me was worth the suffering that average suffering that it caused

            - Now, I know that **(click)** systemic change is often more important than individual change, but that's more of an argument *for* changing a system than it is an argument *against* changing my own behavior

            - At this point I was experiencing cognitive consonance

            - It's acute when we realize **(click)** that our values and our actions are misaligned
            - My actions and values weren't *deliberately* misaligned, they just *happened* to be misaligned **(click)** because of my own default states
            - Cognitive dissonance feels unsettling. It's not a very comfortable state to sit in.

            - In a few different ways.
            - We can **(click)** practice **denial** because if we deny that there's an inconsistency, then discomfort dissipates
            - Or we can **(click)** use **avoidance**: if we avoid shining a light on the dissonance, then the discomfort will only happens rarely
            - Alternatively... **(click)** we can **change our beliefs** to be more consistent with our behavior...
              - Either by deciding that the inconsistency isn't very significant
              - Or by adopting new beliefs that bridge the gap between our beliefs and our actions
            - Lastly, **(click)** we can **change our behavior** to be more consistent with our beliefs.
            - Sometimes that's easy, but the more engrained our behavior is, the harder it is to change
