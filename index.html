            - I run Python Morsels **(click)**, which is a weekly exercise service that helps developers deepen their Python skills in ways that day-to-day coding doesn't
            - I also run a training company, Truthful Technology **(click)**, which gives the me opportunity to help ye clients level-up their team's Python skills through hands-on training sessions
            - I'm going to be talking about some of the things I've learned while teaching Python to teams
            - I'll also be drawing on my experience organizing meetups and coaching at volunteer-run Python and Django workshops over the years
            - **Disclaimer**: I don't have a background in teaching teachers, *but* I have learned a few things over the years about teaching, coaching, and mentoring that I feel qualified enough to share...

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - I'm interested in metacognition partly because it's related to what I do and related to what I've done
            - I teach Python, which means thinking about thinking is useful for me
            - But I was also one of the founding members of the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct work group...
            - And one of the benefits of being in that work group is that you get to be an observer of human behavior

            - I should probably note at this point that...
            - When it comes to metacognition, I am
              - a learner
              - a dabbler
              - and a hobbyist
              - I *have* done quite of thinking about these topics, but that doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about
              - So consider yourself warned

            - Linguistic relativism is the idea that our language shapes our thoughts
            - Having a word for an idea makes it easier to discuss that idea *and* easier to think about it
            - But it's not just our language that shapes our perception of the world
            - The package that our words come in *also* shapes our perceptions

            - Every once in a while, I think about how I might improve the ways that I teach my students
            - There is *always* some way that I could be teaching better than I am
            - So I read books about teaching
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>TODO show some books</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Among other books, I've read Make it Stick
            - How we Learn
            - Learn Better
            - Learn Like a Pro
            - Learning about a way to improve my abilities is exciting but it's also nerve-wracking
            - Right after I've learned about a way I could improve, I feel a strong urge to immediately improve

            <li class="fragment">Deny that there's a problem</li>
            <li class="fragment">Appreciate the status quo while acknowledging the problem</li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Once I've learned about a possible improvement, I have two options:
            - I can **drop everything** I'm doing and pour all of my energy into fixing the problem that I didn't even know was a problem just days before
            - Or I can **ignore the new information**, deny that there's any problem, and decide that everything is as good as it can possibly be
            - Those are pretty much the only options...
            - At least that's the way it feels right after I've learned something new
            - But there's, of course, an in-between...
            - I could try to both appreciate what I have so far *and* gradually improve what I have to make it cloner to the idealizer version of my curriculum that I imagine might one day exist
