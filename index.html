            - When deciding what I want to talk to you all about...
            - I initially thought that I was going to talk to about how to **(click)** learn more effectively
            - I would have talked about...
              - How **(click)** we don't learn by putting information *into* our heads but by trying to retrieve information *from* our heads
              - We often overvalue books and videos and undervalue all forms of quizzing, including writing code
              - I also would have talked about the importance of **(click)** *deliberate* practice, meaning writing code for the *sake* of learning rather than for productivity's sake
              - And that, counter-intuitively, **(click)** spending a practice sessions bouncing between different topics is often a more effective learning strategy than dedicating a study session to just *one* topic
              - Also **(click)** short *daily* study sessions are often more effective than longer *weekly* study sessions
              - And **(click)** explaining an idea in your own words by making connections to existing knowledge is both helpful and fun
              - These are all important learning techniques...
              - But this talk is *not* about learning
              - Though... all of these learning topics do share something in common

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
<span class="fragment bold">Explicit is better than implicit.</span>
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
<span class="fragment bold">Readability counts.</span>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</span>

            - We *can't* completely avoid our cognitive biases. Most of our thinking involves mental shortcuts by *necessity* and shortcuts always have a risk an accidental bias.
            - In the book **(click)** Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman talks about **(click)** System 1 and **(click)** System 2, which...
            - I think are unfortunately *awful* names
            - You can think of System 1 as "fast thinking" **(click)** and System 2 as "slow thinking" **(click)**
            - Fast thinking involves fast and nearly effortless mental work
            - Slow thinking involves slow and deliberate mental work
            - It might seem like slow thinking is better...
            - but we *can't* force our brain to use slow thinking for all of our actions... and we wouldn't *really* want to
            - Slow thinking requires *more energy* and *more time*
            - So fast thinking *is* absolutely necessary, though it's also the cause of many our cognitive biases

            - You often can't *avoid* biases, but recognizing them can help us react to them and try to work around them **(click)**
            - Though it's *a lot* easier to recognize a cognitive bias in someone else's thinking than in our own
            - Which of course **(click)** is another kind of cognitive bias
            - So try to focus on recognizing *your own* biases first
            - You can't get rid of your own biases, but you *can* try to respond to them

            - As we've already seen, you can *append* a list **(click)** *to itself* in Python
            - Python is smart enough **(click)** to represent that list using 3 dots **(click)** because otherwise it would need to show an infinite number of square brackets
            - Interestingly, that string representation is *also* valid Python code **(click)**
            - Though it represents a list containing **(click)** a list containing a Python's special `Ellipsis` object
            - Which is a bit odd
            - I call this kind of code a "Python Oddity"

            - When I say "oddity" I don't mean a bug in Python

            - A good oddity will help reveal that **(click)** the way you think about Python happens to differ from the way Python thinks about itself
            - I collect Python oddities **(click)** because they help me and folks who come to me to learn Python, *challenge* our mental models of Python

            - Every concept in our head has some sort of mental models attached to it
            - Our brain forms mental models implicitly
            - But it's often helpful to make our model models more explicit
            - This can help us discover where our models of the world break down and where they don't
            - Let's test your mental model of Python's variables and data structures...

            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, **(click)** the list is copied into a new bucket **(click)**
            - Let's say we then append `9` to that first list **(click)**, which would **(click)** mutate the first list
            - But the second list shouldn't change... **(click)**
            - ... Except it *does* **(click)** change!
            - This mental model **(click)** isn't going to work
            - Variables in Python are *not* like buckets that contain objects

            - Let's mentally model variables as **(click)** sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, we attach that variable name to the object **(click)**
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(click)** attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change **(click)** that first list, the first one changes **(click)** but the second one changes also **(click)**... because it's all just one list

            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references **(click)** or pointers
            - We have two words: **(click)** variable land and **(click)** object land
            - Variables live in variable land and they *point* to objects that live in object land
            - So when we **(click)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(click)** that variable to that new list object
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we point **(click)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(click)** modify the first list **(click)**...
            - The first list changes **(click)** and so does the second **(click)** because *they're the same list*
            - But wait... why does our list have an arrow pointing to an integer?
            - Well, just as variables don't contain objects, neither do objects
            - Objects can only *point* to objects, so the list's index `0` **(click)** points to the integer `9` **(click)**
            - That's also why...

            - ... if we **(click)** put our list inside another list, we'll simply be **(click)** pointing one of the indexes in that new list to *our* existing list
            - Variables can point to objects and objects can point to other objects.
            - Nothing ever points to variables.
            - Variables are just a name that references an object living in object land
            - This mental model *is* a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it also makes it easier to understand how data structures work.

            - This is *not* a real thing. **(click)** It *is* possible to think thoughts that we have no words for. That's how *new* words come to exist.
            - Linguistic relativism **(click)** is the idea that our language *doesn't* determine our thoughts, but it does *affect* them

            - There's an interaction I've had repeatedly over the years:
            - A Python learner will tell me that they've assigned two variables (`first` and `second`) to the same value and then they'll say **(click)** "when I change `first`, it doesn't *always* change `second`"
            - When I ask what they mean, inevitably they'll show me something like this...
            - "here I changed first" **(click)** "and second changed" **(click)**
            - But "*here* when I change first" **(click)**... "second doesn't change" **(click)**
            - Why?
            - The word "change" **(click)** is the problem here.

            - So instead of using the word "change" **(click)** I encourage folks learning with me to be more explicit **(click)**
            - ... as the Zen of Python says: explicit is better than implicit
            - When we **(click)** reassign first, second still points to the same object
            - But if we instead **(click)** mutate the object that first points to, if second points to the same object, then both first and second will seem as if they changed
            - The word change **can be ambiguous** in Python... and ambiguity can reinforce fuzzy and incorrect mental models

            - For the sake of simplicity, I've removed the extra arrows that would normally be pointing from each index in our list to separate integer objects
            - This is mostly fine since integers in Python are immutable, so there's no risk of an integer *object* changing
            - So we've assigned `second` to `first` which means both variables now point to the same 4-item list
            - When we append to `first` **(click)**, the list changes **(click)**
            - When we look at `second`, **(click)** we'll see that it changed because it points to the same list
            - But if we reassign `first`, **(click)** we're pointing that variable to a *new* list **(click)**
            - Which means `second` is unchanged **(click)**
            - The `second` variable still points to the original list, which hasn't been touched
            - This is why the word "change" is ambiguous: mutations change objects and assignments change *which* object a *variable* points to

            - Over the years, I've gradually became became more careful about my word choice
            - While teaching, **(click)** I used to use phrases like "`colors` contains a list" **(click)**

            - But I found that using these phrases sometimes caused confusion **(click)**, especially when I tried to teach how variables actually work
            - Now I usually use the phrase "points to" **(click)**
            - This phrase doesn't hint at an incorrect mental model **(click)**

            - But even after a code of conduct was written...
            - There wasn't any official contact information to use for reporting issues for the next 3 years **(click)**
            - And there wasn't a group of individuals dedicated to handling Code of Conduct issues until the Code of Conduct work group was formed a year later **(click)**
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about 10 sentences long and those of us *in* this new workgroup soon realized that it wasn't actually enforceable...
            - Until it was rewritten a couple years later...**(click)**
            - Today the PSF has an actionable Code of Conduct with publicly documented processes around reporting and enforcement and Code of Conduct issues are handled by a dedicated group of volunteers
            - But before 2019, the process for addressing code of conduct issues within certain PSF spaces was **(click)** ...unspecified

            - I launched the Python Morsels web app in September 2018
            - I launched it as a service to help working Python developers level-up their skills by solving a real-word Python exercise every week
            - But it wasn't actually *started* in September 2018
            - It started, as a paid email list in February 2018
            - For the first 6 months of its existence, there was no website
            - Well, it *sort of* had a website... there was a single page with a buy button
            - Of course, it didn't *really* start in February either. I started beta testing the exercises for this service with a few friends in October of 2017.
            - Even when the web app launched though... there was no way to grade your work until the next year
            - And if learners wanted solve exercises more often or less often than once a week, they were out of luck... for first 3 years
            - You've probably heard the phrase "minimum viable product"
            - When you're starting a new project, it's easiest to start with the *smallest* steps you *can* to gather feedback, and then iterate
            - That **first step** will probably be *smaller* than the ideal end result that you're imagining
