            - First: I run a service called Python Morsels that help folks deeper their Python skills and **(click)** I have stickers that look like this
            - Ask me for a sticker after my talk if you want one
            - Second... a disclaimer:
            - This is a very rough version of what *will* be a 45 minute keynote that I'm giving at a conference about a month from today
            - I decided that the best way to trick myself into *not* procrastinating on this talk was to commit to giving it a month before I needed it to exist
            - Spoilers: I still procrastinated and, as you will see, this talk is not yet done.

            - Let's say we have a list of numbers
            - And we define a function **(click)** that uses the `+=` operator on that list of numbers
            - If we pass a list to this function, **(click)** what do you think we might see?
            - What will this code output?
            - It might print before and after with different numbers
            - They could be the same numbers
            - Or maybe an exception is raised on that `+=` line
            - **(click)** It turns out... this code does raises an exception...
            - But it raises it **(click)** on the *first* line in this function
            - So nothing prints at all
            - This happens because each variable name within a function is tied to one *specific* scope and Python determines a variable's scope when it *parses* the function, not when the function is called
            - Since we're **(click)** assigning to this `numbers` variable, it must be a local variable... but that means we're **(click)** trying to read from a local variable before we've even assigned to it **(click)**
            - I collect snippets of code like this
            - I call this kind of code a "Python Oddity"

            - Every concept in our head has some sort of mental models attached to it
            - Our brain forms mental models implicitly
            - But it's often helpful to make our model models more explicit
            - This can help us discover where our models of the world break down and where they don't
            - We just saw a Python oddity that tested our mental models of Python's variables and data structures

            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(click)** attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change **(click)** that first list, the first one changes **(click)** but the second one changes also **(click)**... because it's all just one list

            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references or pointers
            - When we **(click)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(click)** that variable to the object
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we point **(click)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(click)** modify the first list **(click)**, the first list changes **(click)** and so does the second **(click)** because *they're the same list*
            - And if we **(click)** put our list inside another list, we'll simply be **(click)** pointing one of the indexes in that new list to *our* existing list
            - This mental model *is* a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it also makes it easier to understand how data structures work
            - I'd argue that this mental model is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects
            - But keep in mind that *every* mental model has its limits

            - For example, when Steve Jobs, announced the price of the iPad, **(click)** he displayed $999 on the screen for many seconds before eventually announcing that the price of an iPad would be $499 **(click)**
            - That made the iPads *immediately* seem inexpensive
            - This doesn't just apply to prices though...

            - Here's another example...
            - Imagine your manager asks you how long a new project will take
            - They say: **(click)** can you get this done in 13 weeks?
            - And you say: **(click)** sure we can get it done in 8 weeks.
            - What if instead, they had said: **(click)** can you do this in a week?
            - You're likely to say something like: absolutely not.
            - **(click)** This will take 4 weeks.
            - The anchoring bias is real and it takes a lot of very deliberate and slow thinking to overcome

            - We *cannot* possibly overcome all of our cognitive biases at all times. Most of our thinking involves mental shortcuts by necessity and shortcuts always have a risk an accidental bias.
            - In the book **(click)** Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman talks about **(click)** System 1 and **(click)** System 2, which...
            - (speaking of naming things)
            - are *awful* names
            - You can think of these as "fast thinking" **(click)** and "slow thinking" **(click)**
            - Fast thinking involves fast and nearly effortless mental work
            - Slow thinking involves slow and deliberate mental work
            - It might seem like slow thinking is better...
            - but slow thinking requires more energy and time than fast thinking and there's no way to force our brain to use it for all of our actions... and we wouldn't *really* want to
            - Fast thinking *is* absolutely necessary, though it's also the cause of many our cognitive biases

          <h2>Words Matter</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - TODO when describing Python's variables, don't use the terms "contains", "holds", or even "is". Those words might implicitly lead someone new to Python to assume an incorrect mental model
            - TODO words matter only so much...
              - variables in Python aren't pointers because they can't be dereferenced
              - If someone says the phrase "generator comprehension", I know they mean "generator expression" and in fact every time I hear generator comprehension I *wish* that was the official term
              - The phrase "the `reversed` function" is technically incorrect because `reversed` is actually a class... but that phrase is also perfectly acceptable because we thanks to duck typing in Python, the word "function" is often used to mean "an object you can call" rather than an actual function object
              - The phrases `print` method and `print` statement are technically incorrect and I try to avoid those as a teacher, but I also try to only gently nudge my students toward talking about `print` as a function.
              - The term "argument" can be confusing... function argument, command-line argument, or are we talking about a variable name in a function definition... which is technically a parameter but the words "variable" or "argument" are often used instead
              - "We call the `append` function on the list" might paint a slightly different picture than "we call the `append` method on the list" even thuogh methods are technically functions
              - Using phrases like instatiate, declare, etc... can be confusing
              - When we talk about a generator, do we mean a generator object or a generator function?
              - Named concepts that I'm grateful for: duck typing, monkey patching, truthiness (technically called truth value testing), dunder methods (officially "special methods"), the "walrus operator" and "assignment expressions" (one about the operator and the other about the expression)

            - **(click)** Many traditional forms of teaching often explicitly or implicitly *encourage blocked practice*

            - And until a year after that, **(click)** there wasn't actually a group of individuals dedicated to handling Code of Conduct issues... everything was handled directly by the board of directors
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about 10 sentences long and it wasn't actually enforceable...

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - In 2020, I listened to some podcast interviews that started me down a path of questioning some of my actions and my beliefs
            - I realized that I had (and *still* have) some implicit mental models that are both incomplete and inconsistent
            - I believed that **(click)** meat tastes really good
            - And **(click)** suffering is bad
            - Even if suffering experienced by animals is at least *a little bit* bad
            - These two ideas aren't *actually* contradictory... both of these statements are true
            - But there is a *possible* problem caused by these two beliefs...
            - You might be wondering whether I'm purposely trying to **(click)** get on a high horse and paint myself as somehow better than you are
            - I'm not... but I *do* want to talk about morality...

          <h1>Moral Frameworks</h1>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Deontology</strong>: Good Actions and Bad Actions</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Consequentialism</strong>: Good Outcomes and Bad Outcomes</p>
          <p class="fragment">All Actions Bundle Good and Bad</p>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - There are 2 primary moral frameworks that I've heard philosophers talk about
            - Deontology, **(click)** which is a belief that each action is either right or wrong and we should try to perform only right actions.
            - and Consequentialism, **(click)** which is a belief that actions should be judged based on their outcomes
            - Both of these moral frameworks have problems
            - Deontology focuses on the intent of an action and can lead to a fixation on minimizing bad actions while ignoring the outcomes of our actions
            - But consequentialism requires guessing about the outcomes of our actions and guesses are *bound* to be faulty
            - Problems aside, at heart, I am *mostly* a consequentialist
            - Meaning I believe that most of the time **(click)** we should try to weigh the good and the bad and maximize the outcome as best as we can
            - This *does* require guesswork... but I sincerely think the outcomes of an action are at least a bit more important than the intent behind the action

          <h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index=2>Consuming meat causes pleasure</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - So back in 2020, I came to the conclusion that, the production of most pieces of meat involved suffering **(click)**
            - I can't say that I *didn't* know this before 2020, but I do know that I didn't think about very much
            - And I don't think I'm incredible at compartmentalizing, but even after I started thinking about this... **(click)**
            - I still found that meat tastes great
            - Which means **(click)** I'd need to take a guess at whether the enjoyment that each bite of meat brought me was worth the suffering that average suffering that it caused

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - I'll spare you the details, but I eventually came to the conclusion that...
            - The **(click)** pleasure I experience from meat, **(click)** on average, probably **(click)** less than the suffering
            - Now, I know that **(click)** systemic change is often more important than individual change, but that's more of an argument *for* changing a system than it is an argument *against* changing my own behavior

          <h1>Cognitive Dissonance</h1>
          <p class="fragment">Holding conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes</p>
          <p class="fragment">Especially when values and actions are misaligned</p>
          <p class="fragment">Let's blame my default state</p>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - At this point I was experiencing cognitive consonance
            - That's discomfort that occurs when we find that our brain contains **(click)** conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes
            - It's acute when we realize **(click)** that our values and our actions are misaligned
            - My actions and values weren't *deliberately* misaligned, they just *happened* to be misaligned **(click)** because of my own default states
            - Cognitive dissonance feels unsettling. It's not a very comfortable state to sit in.
            - But it *can* be resolved..

          <h2>Remedying Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Deny the inconsistency</strong>: "everything is fine"</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Avoid the inconsistency</strong>: "Out of sight, out of mind"</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Change your beliefs</strong>: downplay or add layers</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Change your behavior</strong>: easier said than done</p>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - In a few different ways.
            - We can **(click)** practice **denial** because if we deny that there's an inconsistency, then discomfort dissipates
            - Or we can **(click)** use **avoidance**: if we avoid shining a light on the dissonance, then the discomfort will only happens rarely
            - Alternatively... **(click)** we can **change our beliefs** to be more consistent with our behavior...
              - Either by deciding that the inconsistency isn't very significant
              - Or by adopting new beliefs that bridge the gap between our beliefs and our actions
            - Lastly, **(click)** we can **change our behavior** to be more consistent with our beliefs.
            - Sometimes that's easy, but the more engrained our behavior is, the harder it is to change

            - I still consume food that I believe caused more harm than good
            - So I am still living with cognitive dissonance.
            - Sometimes I avoid it. Sometimes I deny it.
            - But it is **(click)** *slowly* decreasing because I am **(click)** *very gradually* changing my behavior.
            - My actions and my beliefs are still less *aligned* than I would like... but I *am* making progress

            - So that part of this talk may have felt a bit uncomfortable, **(click)** but none of you threw vegetables at me... which is actually **(click)** a bit of a shame.

            - But the most challenging perspective isn't the first-person or the third-person but the **(click)** second-person...
