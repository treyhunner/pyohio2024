          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Every concept in our head has some sort of mental models attached to it
            - Our brain forms mental models implicitly
            - But it's often helpful to make our model models more explicit
            - This can help us discover where our models of the world break down and where they don't
            - We just saw a Python oddity that tested our mental models of Python's variables and data structures

            - If we assign a variable to an empty list, that variable contains that list
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, the list is copied into a new bucket
            - Which is why when we change the first list, the second list doesn't change...
            - ... Except it *does* change!
            - That mental model isn't going to work
            - Let's try another one...

          <h1>Mental Model 2: Sticky Notes on Objects</h1>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Let's mentally model variables as sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list, we attach that variable name to the object
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, we simply attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change that first list, the second one would change also... because it's all just one list
            - TODO show second = first and append to first
            - TODO show diagram of two separate buckets
            - If we assign a variable to an empty list, that variable contains that list
            - If we set `a` to an empty list, then set `b` to a`, and append to `b`, `a` changes also
            - This mental model works pretty well!
            - TODO another slide...
            - But what if we put that list inside another list?
            - Do we add a sticky note that says which list it's in and which index it's at?
            - What if we point another variable to the outer list? Do we need to add *another* sticky note on the object?
            - This is getting complicated
            - Let's give up on this mental model and try a third one...
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h1>Mental Model 3: Pointers or "References"</h1>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references or pointers
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* that variable to the object
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, we point the second variable to the same object
            - If we put our list inside another list, we simply point one of the indexes in that new list to *our* list
            - TODO show second = first and append to first
            - TODO show diagram of two separate buckets
            - This mental model is a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it makes it easier to understand how data structures work
            - I'd argue that this mental model is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects
            - But keep in mind that *every* mental model has its limits
