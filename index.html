              - How **(click)** we don't learn by putting information *into* our heads but by trying to retrieve information *from* our heads
              - We often overvalue books and videos and undervalue all forms of quizzing, including writing code
              - I also would have talked the fact that importance of **(click)** *deliberate* practice, meaning writing code for the *sake* of learning rather than for productivity's sake
              - And that, counter-intuitively, **(click)** spending a practice sessions bouncing between different topics is often a more effective learning strategy than dedicating a study session to just *one* topic
              - Also **(click)** short daily study sessions are often more effective than longer study sessions once a week
              - And **(click)** explaining an idea in your own words by making connections to existing knowledge is both helpful and fun
              - These are all important learning techniques...

I'm talking about thinking about your own thinking and thinking about the thinking of others, both in a reflective way and in deliberate future-thinking way. Deliberacy and explicitness of thought. Explicit is better than implicit. -->

            - Our brain forms mental models implicitly

            - We could try to mentally model Python's variables and data structures as buckets that contain objects
            - If we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, that variable contains that list **(click)**
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, **(click)** the list is copied into a new bucket **(click)**
            - Let's say we then append `9` to that first list **(click)**, which would **(click)** mutate the first list
            - But the second list shouldn't change... **(click)**
            - ... Except it *does* **(click)** change!
            - This mental model **(click)** isn't going to work
            - Variables in Python are *not* like buckets that contain objects
            - Let's try another one...

            - Let's mentally model variables as sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, we attach that variable name to the object **(click)**
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(click)** attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change **(click)** that first list, the first one changes **(click)** but the second one changes also **(click)**... because it's all just one list

            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references or pointers
            - When we **(click)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(click)** that variable to the object
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we point **(click)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(click)** modify the first list **(click)**, the first list changes **(click)** and so does the second **(click)** because *they're the same list*
            - And if we **(click)** put our list inside another list, we'll simply be **(click)** pointing one of the indexes in that new list to *our* existing list
            - This mental model *is* a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it also makes it easier to understand how data structures work
            - I'd argue that this mental model is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects
            - But keep in mind that *every* mental model has its limits

            - These faces are actually the same color
            - Both faces use the RGB color #7c7c7c **(click)**
            - that's a shade of gray that's pretty right in between white and black
            - This optical illusion relies on a mental model that our brain uses automatically
            - Our brain is trying to correct for what it perceives as a difference in the quality of light around these two faces

            - There's also the anchoring bias

            - We *can't* overcome all of our cognitive biases. Most of our thinking involves mental shortcuts by necessity and shortcuts always have a risk an accidental bias.
            - In the book **(click)** Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman talks about **(click)** System 1 and **(click)** System 2, which...
            - (some foreshadowing for when we talk about names in a moment...)
            - but these are *awful* names
            - You can think of System 1 and System 2 as "fast thinking" **(click)** and "slow thinking" **(click)**
            - Fast thinking involves fast and nearly effortless mental work
            - Slow thinking involves slow and deliberate mental work
            - It might seem like slow thinking is better...
            - but slow thinking requires more energy and time than fast thinking and there's no way to force our brain to use it for all of our actions... and we wouldn't *really* want to
            - Fast thinking *is* absolutely necessary, though it's also the cause of many our cognitive biases

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - TODO if I keep this section, I'm considering rearranging it to be like this:
            - naming variables in your code is important for the sake of readability (as is using variable names instead of indexes)
            - it's hard for me to teach Python's many asterisk syntaxes because they lack clearly defined names that everyone agrees on... unlike the "walrus operator" which we all call "the walrus operator". It has a name, it looks like the name, and it's memorable.
            - name things, well
            - names paint mental models, both explicitly and implicitly
            - Years ago, while teaching I used to use phrases like "x contains a list" or "x is a list". I found that these phrases made it harder to explain the way Python's variables work.
            - There is a repeated interaction I've had over the years: "I changed x and y changed, but here when I change x, y doesn't change". The word "change" is the problem here. That word is accidentally playing two different roles... it's like the word biannually or "ounces"... are we talking weight or volume?
            - So instead of using the word "change", I encourage folks learning with me to be more explicit (as the Zen of Python says)
            - Note whether we're assigning (changing a variable) or mutating (changing an object)
            - The words we choose are important, especially when we use certain words and phrases habitually or when our words will be heard or read by many people
            - Thinking about the mental models behind your words can make you a better documenter, a better technical writing, and a better teacher
            - And more generally thinking about the words and phrases we use can make you a better coworker and a better friend: see Ned Batchelder's keynote on interpersonal interactions (and April Wensel's talk and Jesse Jiryu Davis' talk too?)

            - But it's also important to recognize when we can *give a name* to an object **(click)** that might otherwise go unnamed
            - Instead of *indexing* a 2-item tuple **(click)**

            - Words have 
            - When I'm teaching Python, I find that the phrases I use can **(click)** accidentally imply an incorrect mental model
            - Let's say **(click)** we've assigned a `colors` variable to a list of strings
            - So `colors` contains a list **(click)**
            - Except... it doesn't **(click)**
            - Because variables don't *contain* objects in Python
            - Okay... maybe we could say
            - `colors` *is* a list **(click)**
            - That's *better*, **(click)** but it sort of implies that there's a one-to-one relationship between our variable and the list.
            - ... which isn't the case
            - What if we said `colors` **(click)** *points to* a list?
            - This one might sound a little funny, but **(click)** this is the phrase I usually use while teaching
            - Even when I never mention the words pointer or reference, that verb "points" **(click)** evokes a more accurate mental picture

              - The term "argument" can be confusing... function argument, command-line argument, or are we talking about a variable name in a function definition... which is technically a parameter but the words "variable" or "argument" are often used instead
              - "We call the `append` function on the list" might paint a slightly different picture than "we call the `append` method on the list" even thuogh methods are technically functions

            - The Python Software Foundation was formed in 2001  **(click)**
            - And the foundation didn't have a Code of Conduct **(click)** for its first decade of existence
            - But even after a code of conduct was written...
            - **(click)** There wasn't any official contact information to use use for reporting conduct issues in online PSF spaces for the next 3 years
            - And until a year after that, **(click)** there wasn't actually a group of individuals dedicated to handling Code of Conduct issues... everything was handled directly by the board of directors
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about 10 sentences long and it wasn't actually enforceable...
            - **(click)** Until a couple years later...
            - Today the PSF has an actionable Code of Conduct with publicly documented reporting and enforcement processes and Code of Conduct issues are handled by a dedicated group of volunteers
            - ...
            - It's sometimes hard not to get discouraged by an exceptionally imperfect situation...

            - blocked practice **(click)** involves dedicating a block of time to practicing *one* specific topic
            - interleaved practice **(click)** involves jumping back and forth between multiple topics within a single practice session
            - **(click)** Many traditional forms of teaching either explicitly or implicitly *encourage blocked practice*
            - But interleaved practice is often more effective than blocked practice
            - After learning about this, I *immediately* wished that **(click)** I could change all of my curriculum...

            - Which evolutionarily, might be a good idea...

            - Today, I would have solved my problem by using the `json` module in the Python standard library.
            - But at the time, we were using Python 2.4, which did not *have* a `json` module.
            - There was a third-party `simplejson` library, which later became the official `json` module.
            - But I chose not to use that.
            - Instead, I wrote my own JSON formatter.

            - Today, I think of "Not Invented" here as "Not Thought of By Me".
            - "Not Thought of By Me" is a bit broader...
            - Instead of asking your coworker to help you brainstorm a problem, you might try to solve everything on your own.
            - What if you don't have a coworker to ask?
            - Well, there's always a search engine.
            - And today, there's always a chat bot.
            - And yes, you should *not* assume a chat bot will give you the right answer, in full the first time you ask it a question.
            - But you also shouldn't assume that the code you found on StackOverflow is correct
            - And you should probably check to very that the third-party library you're using actually does what you *think* it does
            - You should verify that your solution actually works... but that doesn't mean you need to invent the solution yourself.

            - TODO show image of a local meetup on this slide, with me in it?
            - About 10 years ago, some of my local meetups decided to add explicit codes of conduct and the code of conduct was noted at the beginning of every meeting.
            - I remember after one meetup event, an attendee told me that the code of conduct made him feel uncomfortable.
            - He felt that the code of conduct being mentioned at every meeting made him feel like he needed to be extra careful about what he said around others.
            - I told this attendee that I understood his feeling.
            - He acknowledged that he would probably acclimate to the code of conduct the same way humans tend to acclimate to other changes in environment and behavior.
            - Humans are reselient, but acclimating *does* take time.
            - But we didn't just talk about acclimating...

            - But as the "Zen of Python" says "simple is better than complex", so I'm going to oversimplify things **(click)**
            - The 2 primary moral frameworks are deontology and consequentialism
            - Deontology judges the morality of an action based on the intent behind our actions
            - We have either good intent or bad intent
            - Consequentialism judges actions based on their outcomes
            - Both of these moral frameworks have problems that I'm not going to get into
            - Problems aside I am *mostly* a consequentialist

            - So...
            - Accept that you have a beautiful but flawed human brain
            - Give your beliefs names and shapes
            - Try to make your mental models explicit, rather than implicit
            - Iterate on your beliefs and your actions
            - And accept that if you're making progress, then you will sometimes experience cognitive dissonance
            - Sit with that discomfort
            - And try to respond to it...
            - And try to imagine what someone else might be experiencing and you might want to change your own thinking and behavior based on the experiences of others
