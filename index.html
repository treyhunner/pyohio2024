            - When deciding what I want to talk to you all about...
            - I initially thought that I was going to talk to about how to **(click)** learn more effectively
            - I would have talked about...
              - How **(click)** we don't learn by putting information *into* our heads but by trying to retrieve information *from* our heads
              - We often overvalue books and videos and undervalue all forms of quizzing, including writing code
              - I also would have talked about the importance of **(click)** *deliberate* practice, meaning writing code for the *sake* of learning rather than for productivity's sake
              - And that, counter-intuitively, **(click)** spending a practice sessions bouncing between different topics is often a more effective learning strategy than dedicating a study session to just *one* topic
              - Also **(click)** short *daily* study sessions are often more effective than longer *weekly* study sessions
              - And **(click)** explaining an idea in your own words by making connections to existing knowledge is both helpful and fun
              - These are all important learning techniques...
              - But this talk is *not* about learning
              - Though... all of these learning topics do share something in common

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
<span class="fragment bold">Explicit is better than implicit.</span>
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
<span class="fragment bold">Readability counts.</span>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</span>

            - Interestingly, that string representation is *also* valid Python code **(click)**
            - Though it represents a list containing **(click)** a list containing a Python's special `Ellipsis` object
            - Which is a bit odd
            - I call this kind of code a "Python Oddity"

            - When I say "oddity" I don't mean a bug in Python
            - I mean "something that might catch you by surprise, especially if you're newer to Python"
            - A good oddity will help reveal that **(click)** the way you think about Python happens to differ from the way Python thinks about itself
            - I collect Python oddities **(click)** because they help me and folks who come to me to learn Python, *challenge* our mental models of Python

            - Every concept in our head has some sort of mental models attached to it
            - Our brain forms mental models implicitly
            - But it's often helpful to make our model models more explicit
            - This can help us discover where our models of the world break down and where they don't
            - We just saw a Python oddity that tested our mental models of Python's variables and data structures

            - We could try to mentally model Python's variables and data structures as buckets that contain objects
            - If we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, that variable contains that list **(click)**
            - Then when we assign another variable to the first one, **(click)** the list is copied into a new bucket **(click)**
            - Let's say we then append `9` to that first list **(click)**, which would **(click)** mutate the first list
            - But the second list shouldn't change... **(click)**
            - ... Except it *does* **(click)** change!
            - This mental model **(click)** isn't going to work
            - Variables in Python are *not* like buckets that contain objects
            - Let's try another one...

            - Let's mentally model variables as sticky notes on objects
            - When we assign a variable to an empty list **(click)**, we attach that variable name to the object **(click)**
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we simply **(click)** attach *another name* to the same object
            - So when we change **(click)** that first list, the first one changes **(click)** but the second one changes also **(click)**... because it's all just one list
            - This mental model works pretty well!
            - But what if...

            - Let's mentally model variables and data structures as references or pointers
            - When we **(click)** assign a variable to an empty list, we *point* **(click)** that variable to the object
            - Then when we assign **(click)** another variable to the first one, we point **(click)** the second variable to the same object
            - If we **(click)** modify the first list **(click)**, the first list changes **(click)** and so does the second **(click)** because *they're the same list*
            - And if we **(click)** put our list inside another list, we'll simply be **(click)** pointing one of the indexes in that new list to *our* existing list
            - This mental model *is* a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further
            - The indirection between variables and objects is tricky, but it also makes it easier to understand how data structures work
            - I'd argue that this mental model is the closest one to how Python actually models variables and objects
            - But keep in mind that *every* mental model has its limits

            - We *can't* overcome all of our cognitive biases. Most of our thinking involves mental shortcuts by necessity and shortcuts always have a risk an accidental bias.

            - (some foreshadowing for when we talk about names in a moment...)
            - but these are *awful* names
            - You can think of System 1 and System 2 as "fast thinking" **(click)** and "slow thinking" **(click)**
            - Fast thinking involves fast and nearly effortless mental work
            - Slow thinking involves slow and deliberate mental work
            - It might seem like slow thinking is better...

            - When I ask what they mean, inevitably they'll show me something like this...
            - "here I changed x" **(click)** "and y changed" **(click)**
            - But "*here* when I change x" **(click)**... "y doesn't change" **(click)**
            - Why?
            - The word "change" **(click)** is the problem here.

            - "change" is accidentally playing two different roles

            - Or ounces **(click)**... are we talking **(click)** volume or weight?
            - With change: we might be **(click)** changing a variable or we might be changing a value

            - So instead of using the word "change" **(click)** I encourage folks learning with me to be more explicit **(click)**
            - ... as the Zen of Python says: explicit is better than implicit
            - When we **(click)** reassign x, y still points to the same object
            - But if we instead **(click)** mutate the object that x points to, if y points to the same object, then both x and y will seem as if they changed

            - The Python Software Foundation was formed in 2001  **(click)**
            - And the foundation didn't have a Code of Conduct **(click)** for its first decade of existence
            - But even after a code of conduct was written...
            - **(click)** There wasn't any official contact information to use use for reporting conduct issues in online PSF spaces for the next 3 years
            - And until a year after that, **(click)** there wasn't actually a group of individuals dedicated to handling Code of Conduct issues... everything was handled directly by the board of directors
            - But at that point the code of conduct was only about 10 sentences long and those of us *in* this new workgroup soon realized that it wasn't very clearly enforceable...
            - **(click)** Until a couple years later...
            - Today the PSF has an actionable Code of Conduct with publicly documented reporting and enforcement processes and Code of Conduct issues are handled by a dedicated group of volunteers
            - But before 2019, the process for addressing code of conduct issues within certain PSF spaces was **(click)** ...unspecified
            - ...
            - It's sometimes hard not to get discouraged by an exceptionally imperfect situation...
            - I often think of a quote from Hans Rosling...

            - The world can be both *bad* and *better* at the same time

            - Logically, there's no contradiction here... but it can be really challenging to hold both of these ideas in my head at the same time

            - Years ago I read that **blocked practice** is less effective than **interleaved practice**
            - blocked practice **(click)** involves dedicating a block of time to practicing *one* specific topic

            - **(click)** Many traditional forms of teaching either explicitly or implicitly *encourage blocked practice*
            - But interleaved practice is often more effective than blocked practice
            - After learning about this, I *immediately* wished that **(click)** I could change all of my curriculum...

            - Keeping a default in-place is often a good idea
            - Regardless of whether that default comes from a **(click)** social custom, a **(click)** cultural norm, or **(click)** a personal habit
            - But defaults don't *always* lead to the best outcomes... and **(click)**
            - Our brains often *bias* us toward our current default state

            - Sometimes discomfort is a sign that we're actively making progress...

            - So...
            - Accept that you have a beautiful but flawed human brain
            - Give your beliefs names and shapes
            - Try to make your mental models explicit, rather than implicit
            - Iterate on your beliefs and your actions
            - And accept that if you're making progress, then you will sometimes experience cognitive dissonance
            - Sit with that discomfort
            - And try to respond to it...
            - And try to imagine what someone else might be experiencing and you might want to change your own thinking and behavior based on the experiences of others
