- This is the meta portion of the talk, where I tell you what this talk is about... it's about metacognition
- Learning about learning is probably the thing that initially got my interested in metacognition
    - What's effective for learning isn't always aligned with what we *think* is effective
- Mental models
- Mistakes happen... introduce moral philosophy here?
- Cognitive biases (sometimes our mental models are hard to control)
- Naming things... a shortcut to a mental model, sometimes accidentally
- Living with the status quo and occasionally questioning it
- Making progress
- Be kind to yourself, be kind to others
    - Being a human isn't easy. We hold ourselves to high standards... standards that are a bit higher than just "let's not kill each other".

- Python's `functools` module has a function called `wraps` which is a helper for making decorators
- `wraps` is a function that accepts a function and returns a function that accepts a function and returns a function... that's a pretty confusing way to explain `wraps`
- `wraps` is better explained by using an abstraction: it's a decorator that accepts a function as an argument
- We already think about thinking automatically... I think we should do it more often and more deliberately
- I find thinking about metacognition really useful
- If I didn't know the *word* metacognition, I'd need to say that I find thinking about thinking about thinking really useful
- Which is kind of confusing...

- Having names for concepts is *very* helpful
- But our *choice* of names is also important
- Not only is our choice of names important, but how we phrase things can be very important
- Python code, the output of Python code, and the English language are the primary ways I attempt to convey ideas to the folks I teach
- We use words as an attempt to convey a mental models
- The words we use can sometimes subtly convey the wrong idea
    - "Let's update the list" but then we assign to a new list
    - "x contains 4"
    - "x is 4"

- Focus on outcomes
    - Stop focusing on your moral worth. Try to maximize the good in the world.
    - Outcomes matter a lot more than intent
    - Selfish versus selfless doesn't matter nearly as much as maximizing outcomes
    - In 100 years, most likely no one will remember anything that any of us did... but we *can* leave the world a little bit better off in the process
- Admit fault
    - The unfortunate balance of ego:
        - Inflated self-worth: I am good, so if I did something bad there was a good reason.
        - Deflated self-worth: If I did a bad thing, that means I'm bad. I can't handle being bad.
    - A focus on "self" is a slipper slope toward not being able to handle the fact that you made a mistake
    - We all cause harm
        - You did someting that caused harm. Maybe it was a "bad" thing or maybe a "good" thing that had some sort of negative outcome.
        - Doing a "bad" thing or simply causing harm does not mean you're "bad".
        - Your moral worth doesn't matter... at least it doesn't matter to anyone else.
    - Apologizing is hard. It's a learned skill and it's not trivial.
- Work toward improvement
    - Improve your understanding of the world
    - Improve your understanding of yourself
    - Improve your understanding of others
    - Try to improve the world


Why?

Harness metacognition for good

- Think about thinking about thinking (metacognition)
- It can help you model other people's thoughts and feelings and understand the motivation behind their actions
- It can help you understand the reasons behind your own actions
- It can help you shape habits
- It can help you learn
- It can help you teach
- It can help you empathize
- It can help us all be more compassionate

My reasons for this talk are selfish

- I am really interested in metacognition
- I'm a nerd who loves spreading my own interests
- Because the idea that some of you may be interested in what *I'm* interested is exciting
- The more folks in the Python community talk about different aspects of metacognition, the more I get to learn and 
- So I'm hoping to spread my interest of metacognition in the hope help grow your appreciation for this topic
- How metacognition has helped me...

We undervalue metacognition and I want to talk about it myself more often and I'd like the Python community to talk about it more often. Metacognition is at the root of

- The reckoning that stems from confronting difficult realizations
- Self-compassion that we extend ourselves when we realize that our brains are beautiful but also imperfect
- Improved emotional intelligence
- Successful habit formation
- Successful learning and teaching
- Empathy and compassion toward others who have a different model and experience of the world than we do
- Our emotions, including the uncomfortable ones

Naming a thing can be powerful.

You're thinking in terms of mental models all the time, both implicit and explicit ones. You convey meaning through words and you make an impact through actions.



My belief is that thinking about thinking makes me a better person
And learning about learning makes me a better learner and a better teacher

And if this belief holds true for everyone then metacognition is how we become better people, better learners, and better teachers.


Deontology is about "doing what's right"
"It's the thought that counts"
Consequentialism: doesn't matter what you do but what the result is
"The road to hell is paved with bad intentions"
Deontology has a clear right/wrong
Consequentialism leans toward accepting that we might weight things incorrectly
