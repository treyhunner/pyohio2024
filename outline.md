Don't be afraid to acknowledge that *you* are *your actions* are a work-in-progress, all the time. Being a work-in-progress means you're moving forward and that's excellent. Moving forward requires us to acknowledge that there's progress to be made.

Notes after rehearsal with Michael...

Reminding folks what we're talking about and what we're going to talk about... especially toward the end extend that

Someone tried to accomplish something there.
Sometimes the fence isn't what it was intended to do. Question why things are the way they are. Don't assume that something is as it should be, but also don't assume that it has no purpose.


Inventing your own library feels good in the moment until afterward when you realize you now have your own somewhat flawed library to maintain.


Progress:
Melanie would like me to talk about PSF stuff being bad and getting better


Mental models in Python:
I gave Python oddities so much that I gave a talk on it, I've been posting on social media platforms using the #PythonOddity hashtag, I started a repository recently, and I'm planning to get a tattoo

Is Python an object-oriented language or a scripting language (?). It's both.
Is it typed? No, but also yes. Types matter to a certain degree.

The sunk cost fallacy gets us when we've been working for a while trying to get a specific solution to work and then we find that we can't easily get the solution to work... or you found a third-party package after you started down making it yourself.

invalidating your assumptions: writing failing tests first. when trying to write a test that is supposed to fail but it doesn't that implies that your test doesn't work.


## Progress, in full

### PSF's progress

The PSF was around for over a decade before the adopted a code of conduct for their online spaces.

### Hans Rosling quote


### Quote applied to my problems: improving my curriculum.


### What are the small steps?

When solving a programming problem... what's the first step?
Make sure you understand problem.
But what's the first step after that?
Break down the problem into parts.

So much progress comes in the form of small steps...

"Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good"
Make a smaller step than the ideal that you imagine.

Have an idea for a new business... "What's the MVP?"
Start with the smallest steps you can to gather feedback and see where you should go next...

Example: Starting Python Morsels as a mailing list


### Thinking in terms of progress

Related to the growth mindset. It's a lot easier for change and growth to occur if you think that you *can* change and grow.
(borrow this from my mentoring talk)


### Coming back to Hans...

I'd like to look at the two sides of that quote a bit more...

What's the value in appreciating the progress we've made?
If we focus too much on the "bad", without considering the "better", we risk fatalism.
We can't *only* talk about the bad things because we risk fatalism.

But what's the value in recognizing the "bad"?
So we don't take progress (the "better") for granted.

Some of my favorite books on the progress human's have made over time have some very critical reviews that are well worth acknowledging. The most concerning reviews, for me, are the ones from readers who felt that the writing made them feel as if we can simply sit back and watch progress happen... that progress is inevitable.

Enlightenment Now, Factfulness, Not The End of the World...

Positive change isn't inevitable.

If we focus too much on the better we risk complacency...
We need to talk about the bad things. Pointing out problems helps us identify progress-to-be-made.


### End of History illusion.

The End of History Illusion

How much have you changed over the last 10 years?
- Your preferences
- Your personality
- Core values
- Life goals

How much will you change over the next 10 years?

It's hard to predict personal growth because while it's easy to see our past selves as less mature than our current selves, it's hard to feel like *we're* not fully formed.

We don't like to think of ourselves as a work-in-progress, but we *are* a work-in-progress.

Scary thought: If we're a work-in-progress... what does that *mean* about us?

Our brains are constantly changing, whether we like it or not. We may as well embrace that change and try to steer it in a positive direction for ourselves and for everyone else.

Today, you are a work-in-progress. There is progress for *you* to make, for yourself, for your community, and for the world.

Our lives span decades, not centuries.
Life is short.
Enjoy the time you're time you have and try to effect some positive change while you're here.
