Who has heard a word that describes a concept that you didn't know had a name?

Sometimes having a word for a concept can help us think about a concept more easily.

TODO examples

Why?

A word or phrase can act as a shorthand to describe something bigger than itself.

Our brains love shorthands.
It makes things easier to remember and easier to reason about.

TODO linguistic determinism is false. Our language does not strongly determine our thoughts. In other words, (TODO is this right?) there exist categories of ideas that we can conceptualize even though we don't have words for them. Linguistic determinists believe that language we use can limit our thinking.

TODO Linguistic relativity does exist though. (That's the weak version of Sapir-Worf)... that the language we use influences our perceptions. TODO mention examples involving color and other things.

It's not just language that influences our perception though.
When we convey information to others, the way we phrase our words affects the perception.
We all know this.

I really enjoy chatting about Python oddities.

When I say "oddity", I don't mean bug.
I mean "something that might catch you by surprise, especially if you're new".

More specifically, I think of a Python oddity as a bit of code that's surprising when the way you think about Python happens to differ from the way Python thinks about itself.
In other words... when your mental model of Python is different from Python's mental model of itself then you've found a Python oddity.

TODO a few example Python oddities

TODO Our brain forms mental models implicitly, but it's often helpful to make our mental models more explicit

For example... depending on how you use Python and what programming languages you've used before Python, you might not realize that you have a mental model of how variables and data structures work in Python.
That mental model might not closely align with Python's own model of itself.
Or even if your mental model is pretty much right, it may still be a bit fuzzy in some areas.
Making it explicit can help shine a light on those areas, so you can flesh them out more thoroughly.

Let's use Python's variables and objects as an example mental model.

TODO put mental model about variables and objects after this?

A mental model of the world that depends on humans having a considerable amount of free will.

Is that accurate though?

And does it matter?

I think it does.

If every action we take is entirely taken thanks to free will, then every success or mistake that an individual makes is theirs alone. "You get what you deserve."

If instead, our genetics, our childhood environment, and countless other factors shape our actions then that ownership doesn't as much sense anymore. "TODO?"

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

As I read and re-read books about effective and ineffective learning strategies, I often find myself feeling a bit of discomfort over a few competing thoughts:

1. I want to learn how to teach more effectively
2. Every time I teach, I want to teach as effectively as I know how
3. It takes me a lot of time to change my teaching style

Of course I want to learn how to do what I do better.
Once I've learned how to be better, I then feel a strong urge to actually *be* better.
But I can't just suddenly put it all into practice!

I have trainings scheduled.
I have tons and tons of existing curriculum that I've poured hundreds of hours of time into creating.
I have a learning-oriented web app based around ideas that I now believe to be slightly flawed.

I can either:

1. Drop everything I'm doing and pour all of my energy into fixing the problem that until days ago I didn't even know was a problem
2. Decide to ignore this new information, deny that there's a problem, and decide that everything is currently as good as could be

As I learn new things, those often *feel* like the only two options I have.
But there is (of course) an in-between

3. Appreciate what I have and gradually work to make it better

I *could* try to both appreciate what I have so far *and* gradually improve what I have to make it closer to the idealized version of my curriculum that I imagine might one day exist.

I sometimes find comfort in a quote by Hans Rosling from his book Factfulness:

> "The world can be both bad and better. Better is not good enough. It is possible for things to be bad and better."

This is true of some of the most pressing problems in the world and it's true of many parts of my own live.
This is true of:

1. Python skills: they're not as good as they could be, but they're better than they were
2. Teaching skills: I'm a decent teacher, but I can see so much more that I need to improve on
3. Writing skills: I write decently and definitely better than I used to write

Okay, I kind of cheated with that list.
I *am* getter better at those skills, but I'm also pretty decent at them already.

These are things I'm *actually* not very good at, despite being on a mostly positive trajectory:

1. Marketing skills
2. ... TODO

Some examples of how my teaching has changed:

I used to make statements much more often when teaching, but now I try to phrase things as questions as much as possible.

Why: the testing effect. It might work simply because our brains focus on things that surprise us. So if we guess incorrectly we've solidified that surprise. If you say your guess out loud you've made that eventual surprise even more real because you committed a bit more fully to an incorrect guess that your brain now wants to think about.

I also have a habit of explaining a new topic with a bit of telling and a bit interactive questioning, guessing, and quizzing, followed by hands-on exercises.
I eventually learned that this teaching style could be improved upon and it took me years to finally work toward this particular improvement and I *still* haven't fully embraced it.

Why: When learning something new, instead of learning about it and then trying it out, I now try to have students try it out before we've talked about it at all.
We attempt something brand new with the expectation that failure will likely happen.
Then learn about what we were doing and then we do it again, with a slightly more challenging problem.
I think of this as an expected failure, learning, trying again approach.
It takes time for me to rearrange my curriculum toward small pieces of a topic that we can *fail at* before we dive in so I still haven't embraced this as much as I'd like.

I also spent my first couple years while creating Python Morsels thinking in terms of forward motion.
I would recommend an exercise, you'd attempt it, reflect on my solutions and find out new techniques and tools you didn't know about or you hadn't thought to use, and then you were done with the problem... never to see it again.
That last bit of reflection was helpful, but it didn't stick nearly as effectively as it *could* have.

That learning reflection contained useful information.
But we don't learn by reading, right.
It's not putting the information *in* that's most important.
For the sake of memory, it's practicing *retrieval* that matters most.

Revisiting the same exercise a few days later, a few weeks later, or a few months later would have allowed for the opportunity to practice *recall*.
But that's not how Python Morsels was setup.
Revisiting wasn't part of the plan.

My students always wanted to move onto the next topic and I usually do too.
That urge to move onto the next thing does us a disservice when it comes to effective learning.

---

I still wish I taught differently.

I don't embrace interleaved practice as much as I'd like.
Text books tend to teach one topic, and then another, and then another.
Most curriculum works the same way.

TODO more on that

I also know that spaced repetition is incredibly effective... think of flash cards as an example.
Short sessions of practicing active recall, spaced out over days and weeks.
Very few learning systems embrace this learning technique and Python Morsels isn't currently one of them.

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

**Cognitive dissonance**

- Cognitive dissonance is discomfort that occurs when we find that our brain contains conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes.
- Cognitive dissonance can be quite acute when you realize that your values and your actions are misaligned.

Years ago, I organized a group called the San Diego Hacker News meetup.
I originally joined the group years before I was the organizer.
The original organizer moved to the Bay Area, and then the next one moved to the Bay Area, and then the next one did.
So eventually I became the organizer.
I was not going to move to the Bay Area.

But at some point I stopped regularly reading Hacker News.
Partly I didn't have the time and partly I felt that the comments on Hacker News were too often contentious.
I found much of the discussions on Hacker News were overly aggressive and mostly unconstructive.

**cesspool** (shown on the screen while talking about Hacker News comments)

After months of running a meetup for an online space that I didn't care about anymore, I experienced enough cognitive dissonance to change my actions.
I ended the group.

Honestly, that was a pretty mild case of cognitive dissonance.
I felt that didn't really want to support Hacker News, but I also didn't care that much.
Mostly I found myself doing something I was no longer interested in.

---

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.
- I stopped running the Hacker News meetup because it felt inconsistent with my beliefs about it
- I believe software maintainability is important and I also think clever and succinct coding solutions are better than less clever and verbose ones. I reconcile these two beliefs by also thinking that we should focus on hiring software developers who are "smart" enough to understand the clever solutions.
- Code maintainability is paramount. And yet we cut corners when writing tests.
- "Diverse teams are more effective". You just recommended your company hire your friend who has a very similar background to you.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty trade-off, but often it's *not* so obvious... at least not at first.


As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

---

Years later, I experienced much more acute cognitive dissonance.

In 2020 I listened to some podcast interviews that started me down a path of questioning some of my actions and beliefs.

I realized that had and still have a few related mental models in my head that are both incomplete and inconsistent.

I love eating all the types of meat....


Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

Admitting you were wrong with small things is important.

This slide is deliberately blank because I don't want to put shine a light on any one person or event in particular...

When harm happens, 

Danya Ruttenberg has written about apologies and making amends for wrong-doing.

Acknowledge Wrongdoing: Clearly state what you did wrong without explaining away your actions.
Express Remorse: Sincerely express regret for the harm caused.
Make Amends: Take concrete steps to make things right, as best you can.
Commit to Do Better: Demonstrate a commitment avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.
Seek Forgiveness: Request forgiveness, understanding that forgiveness may take a long time or never come.

Your models of the world are always a work-in-progress. Accept that and embrace it.

When a more useful model comes along, try it on.

Then play catch up.
You need to change your mind before you change your actions.

TODO Do chairs exist?

There is no objective experience of reality.

Our brains are simply modeling the world.

Things you can improve:

your mental model of the various social constructs around us:

- Python
- Economics: markets and incentives
    - What are markets and competition good at?
    - What are the downsides to markets?
    - When/where do people's incentives align and where do they misalign?
    - What are positive and negative externalities?
- Politics
    - What are the likely consequences of a new law?
    - What are the likely consequences
- Gender
    - How do different societies perceive gender today?
    - How has the role of gender changed throughout history?
    - What purpose has gender served evolutionarily?
    - What purpose does gender serve today?
- Sexuality
- Religion
- Free will: including blame-worthiness, praise-worthiness and how much of a role luck plays in the specific outcomes over an individual's lifetime
- Self: do individual humans exist?
- Ontology: does anything exist?
- Empathy
    - TODO

300 years from now, which of my actions will look absurd?

We mostly experience the world from a first-person perspective.

Attempting to seek out or model a third-person perspective can be very helpful when seeking a resolution to a conflict.

Taking on a second-person perspective is the hardest, that is thinking from the perspective of the person you're directly interacting with. Empathy.

So in summary:

- Admit that you have a human brain
- Give your beliefs names and shapes
    - Naming things: give important ideas names
    - Mental models: make your mental models explicit
- Iterate, accepting discomfort
- Think outside yourself
    - Modeling your thinking 
    - There are levels to this
- Note opportunities for improvement

- Hold your identity lightly? - Julia Galef
