We often think of mental models are as something we consciously form, but some mental models are unconscious...

---

Availability Bias? Shark attacks.

A bit similar to the anchoring bias in some ways.

---

Attribution Bias?

---

Halo Effect? A well-designed website leads us to assume that the products are good...? Attractiveness and intelligence.

---

Ostrich Effect? 

---

The past is immutable, but the future isn't.

You can't change the actions you've already taken.

You *can* affect the actions you haven't *yet* taken.

---

Deliberately acting differently today than you did yesterday.

Our brains are constantly changing, whether we like it or not. We may as well embrace that change and try to steer it in a positive direction for ourselves and for everyone else.

Progress requires change and progress is nothing to be ashamed of.

---

Our lives span decades, not centuries.

Life is short.

Enjoy the time you're given.

Try to effect positive change as much as you can.

---

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

---

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

---

Purposely incurring technical debt. It requires slowing down your thinking. It requires deliberacy.

---

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty clear cut trade-off, but often the balance is *not* so obvious... at least not at first.

As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

---

Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

---

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

---

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

---

It's hard not to get wrapped up in your own self of `self`

Who are you?

Are you a good person or a bad person?

Are you think kind of person who would `____`?

Our identities are part of us.

---

As Julia Galef said in The Scout Mindset, thinking like a "scout" means holding your identity lightly.

It's not easy to avoid...

Identifying with the code we write

Identifying with the actions we perform

Identifying with the actions we *want to* perform

---

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

---

What are the mental models you have about...

- Python
- Economics
- US politics
- What gender is
- Yourself

---

300 years from now, which of my actions will look absurd?

Which of my actions will look immoral or naive?

---

We mostly experience the world from a first-person perspective.

Attempting to seek out or model a third-person perspective can be very helpful when seeking a resolution to a conflict.

Taking on a second-person perspective is the hardest, that is thinking from the perspective of the person you're directly interacting with. Empathy.

---

So in summary:

- Admit that you have a human brain
- Give your beliefs names and shapes
    - Naming things: give important ideas names
    - Mental models: make your mental models explicit
- Iterate, accepting discomfort
- Think outside yourself
    - Modeling your thinking 
    - There are levels to this
- Note opportunities for improvement

- Hold your identity lightly? - Julia Galef


---

I'm going to talk about:

- Naming Things
- Mental Models
- Iterating on Your Beliefs
- Cognitive Dissonance
- Admitting Your Flaws

That third idea might be a little uncomfortable, but it's the last two ideas that where I'll be hoping you don't throw vegetables at me.


---

You said something in a code review that your coworker was offended by.

How did they experience what you said as offensive?
What were you feeling when you said that?
Why did you feel that?
Why did you say what you did?
Was there another way you *could* have said what you did?

This sort of deliberate reflection takes energy and time.
It can also be emotionally taxing.

The goal isn't to do this for every negative interaction we have... the goal is to help us recognize a pattern so that we can occasionally slow down and act more deliberately until our new thinking patterns and actions become our new habit.

---

I teach Python to groups through team trainings and to individuals through Python Morsels.

I know that 


---

Our brains are very concerned with our perception of ourselves.

Am I smart?

Do I belong?

Am I good?

---

--Cognitive dissonance--

This is partly why cognitive dissonance can be so hard to grapple with.

When my actions don't align with what we feel is good or correct, I feel unsettled.

But cognitive dissonance is just one way to feel uncomfortable.

---

About 10 years ago, many of my local meetups decided to add explicit codes of conduct and noting the code of conduct at the beginning of every meeting.

I remember after one meetup event, an attendee told me that the code of conduct made him feel uncomfortable.

Uncomfortable

He felt like with our frequent mention of the code of conduct that he needed to be careful about what he said around others.

I told this attendee that I understood his feeling.
He acknowledged that he would probably acclimate to the code of conduct the same way he might acclimate to volunteering at an elementary school, where he needed to be careful about his language.

In the meantime, the discomfort he felt might be a good thing.
Maybe the temporary discomfort might nudge him to be a bit more deliberate with his words, especially around new attendees who he might not know well.

Discomfort

---

Uncomfortable

Discomfort

Don't get me wrong...

I'm not advocating for discomfort


---

The point: to help you grapple with the fact that your brian is both an *amazing thing* and it's *constantly making mistakes*.


---

Move vegan section out of default states, after progress, and after discomfort, to talk specifically about cognitive dissonance as a form of discomfort that I continue to sit with.

---

A more real world example with the words and phrases we use.

"Light years" are *not* a measure of time

"Organic food" is a weird phrase because inorganic food doesn't exist. (a metal apple)

A "Calorie" in nutrition and a "calorie" in chemistry are not the same thing... but in a frustrating way.
1 capital-C "Calorie" is equal to 1,000 lowercase-c "calories".

"Serverless"... what does it even mean?

"Theory of Relativity"
Once a theory becomes broadly accepted, it doesn't become a fact... it just stays in "theory" land forever.
The proper functioning of GPS satellites heavily depends of this so-called theory.

"Literally".
I literally do not understand what happened to this word.

"guys"

I don't know about you, but when I have a problem I often think of solutions to my problem that involve writing code.

I wrote Python programs to help me reconcile my finances get my taxes in order.
Could I have used off-the-shelf software to solve this problem *for* me?

But I didn't.

Sometimes, Python is a hammer and our problems all look like nails.

---

Many years ago, I was working an Python project that needed to serialize JSON data.
Today, I would have solved my problem by using the `json` module in the Python standard library.

But at the time, we were using Python 2.4, which did not *have* a `json` module.

There was a third-party `simplejson` library, which later became the official `json` module.
But I chose not to use that.

Instead, I wrote my own JSON formatter.
It was fragile and not something I would want to share publicly... which is the reason I've never talked about it publicly until now.

Why did I do this?

I don't really have an answer.

My guess... is that I was experiencing

"Not Invented Here" syndrome

Why would I use someone else's code when I know how to write the code myself.

---

My *default* state was to write code to solve my problems.

Instead of finding code that someone else had written or, better yet, finding a library that someone was maintaining.... I solved the problem with *my own* code.

---

Today, I think of "Not Invented" here as "Not Thought of By Me".

"Not Thought of By Me" is a bit broader...

Instead of asking your coworker to help you brainstorm a problem, you might try to solve everything on your own.

What if you don't have a coworker to ask?
Well, there's always a search engine.

Or today, there's always a chat bot.

There is NO shame in using Google, asking a coworker for help, or using a chat bot.

And yes, you shouldn't assume a chat bot will give you the right answer, in full the first time you ask it a question.
But you also shouldn't assume that the code you found on StackOverflow is correct or even that the library you're using does what you *think* it does.

Always verify that your solution actually works.
