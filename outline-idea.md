Let's talk about metacognition.
- Metacognition is all about learning about learning... or more broadly, thinking about thinking.

I'm drawn to metacognition, which is probably what drew me to teaching.

I love learning.
But I also I really enjoy learning about learning.

One of these faces is white and one is black.

But they're actually both the same exact shade of gray.

This illusion is due to the way our brain tries to correct for what it perceives as the quality of light within a given space.

This mental model that our brain is making for us is very useful for some things but no so useful for others.

The left and rigth eyes are the same color in these two faces.

Email akitaoka@lt.ritsumei.ac.jp to ask if I can use the images on those two pages in a talk to programmers on their brains and I'll include links to those pages.

I really enjoy thinking about thinking.
I find in interesting to think about my own thinking process and the thinking processes of others.

[Some sort of recursive image]

Why do you think the way you do?

Why do we have the beliefs that we have?

Why do I believe something now that I didn't used to?
TODO example?

What might I no longer believe in the future that I do now?

---

Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm talking about

I do often learn about learning for the sake of improving my teaching style, but most of my interest in metacognition is as a hobby.

I'm mostly a...

- learner
- dabbler
- hobbyist

Who has heard a word that describes a concept that you didn't know had a name?

Sometimes having a word for a concept can help us think about a concept more easily.

TODO examples

Why?

A word or phrase can act as a shorthand to describe something bigger than itself.

Our brains love shorthands.
It makes things easier to remember and easier to reason about.

TODO linguistic determinism is false. Our language does not strongly determine our thoughts. In other words, (TODO is this right?) there exist categories of ideas that we can conceptualize even though we don't have words for them. Linguistic determinists believe that language we use can limit our thinking.

TODO Linguistic relativity does exist though. (That's the weak version of Sapir-Worf)... that the language we use influences our perceptions. TODO mention examples involving color and other things.

It's not just language that influences our perception though.
When we convey information to others, the way we phrase our words affects the perception.
We all know this.

"The medium *is* the message."

I really enjoy chatting about Python oddities.

When I say "oddity", I don't mean bug.
I mean "something that might catch you by surprise, especially if you're new".

More specifically, I think of a Python oddity as a bit of code that's surprising when the way you think about Python happens to differ from the way Python thinks about itself.
In other words... when your mental model of Python is different from Python's mental model of itself then you've found a Python oddity.

TODO a few example Python oddities

TODO Our brain forms mental models implicitly, but it's often helpful to make our mental models more explicit

For example... depending on how you use Python and what programming languages you've used before Python, you might not realize that you have a mental model of how variables and data structures work in Python.
That mental model might not closely align with Python's own model of itself.
Or even if your mental model is pretty much right, it may still be a bit fuzzy in some areas.
Making it explicit can help shine a light on those areas, so you can flesh them out more thoroughly.

Let's use Python's variables and objects as an example mental model.

TODO put mental model about variables and objects after this?

---

A mental model of the world that depends on humans having a considerable amount of free will.

Is that accurate though?

And does it matter?

I think it does.

If every action we take is entirely taken thanks to free will, then every success or mistake that an individual makes is theirs alone. "You get what you deserve."

If instead, our genetics, our childhood environment, and countless other factors shape our actions then that ownership doesn't as much sense anymore. "TODO?"

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

As I read and re-read books about effective and ineffective learning strategies, I often find myself feeling a bit of discomfort over a few competing thoughts:

1. I want to learn how to teach more effectively
2. Every time I teach, I want to teach as effectively as I know how
3. It takes me a lot of time to change my teaching style

Of course I want to learn how to do what I do better.
Once I've learned how to be better, I then feel a strong urge to actually *be* better.
But I can't just suddenly put it all into practice!

I have trainings scheduled.
I have tons and tons of existing curriculum that I've poured hundreds of hours of time into creating.
I have a learning-oriented web app based around ideas that I now believe to be slightly flawed.

I can either:

1. Drop everything I'm doing and pour all of my energy into fixing the problem that until days ago I didn't even know was a problem
2. Decide to ignore this new information, deny that there's a problem, and decide that everything is currently as good as could be

As I learn new things, those often *feel* like the only two options I have.
But there is (of course) an in-between

3. Appreciate what I have and gradually work to make it better

I *could* try to both appreciate what I have so far *and* gradually improve what I have to make it closer to the idealized version of my curriculum that I imagine might one day exist.

---

I sometimes find comfort in a quote by Hans Rosling from his book Factfulness:

> "The world can be both bad and better. Better is not good enough. It is possible for things to be bad and better."

This is true of some of the most pressing problems in the world and it's true of many parts of my own live.
This is true of:

1. Python skills: they're not as good as they could be, but they're better than they were
2. Teaching skills: I'm a decent teacher, but I can see so much more that I need to improve on
3. Writing skills: I write decently and definitely better than I used to write

Okay, I kind of cheated with that list.
I *am* getter better at those skills, but I'm also pretty decent at them already.

These are things I'm *actually* not very good at, despite being on a mostly positive trajectory:

1. Marketing skills
2. ... TODO

Some examples of how my teaching has changed:

I used to make statements much more often when teaching, but now I try to phrase things as questions as much as possible.

Why: the testing effect. It might work simply because our brains focus on things that surprise us. So if we guess incorrectly we've solidified that surprise. If you say your guess out loud you've made that eventual surprise even more real because you committed a bit more fully to an incorrect guess that your brain now wants to think about.

I also have a habit of explaining a new topic with a bit of telling and a bit interactive questioning, guessing, and quizzing, followed by hands-on exercises.
I eventually learned that this teaching style could be improved upon and it took me years to finally work toward this particular improvement and I *still* haven't fully embraced it.

Why: When learning something new, instead of learning about it and then trying it out, I now try to have students try it out before we've talked about it at all.
We attempt something brand new with the expectation that failure will likely happen.
Then learn about what we were doing and then we do it again, with a slightly more challenging problem.
I think of this as an expected failure, learning, trying again approach.
It takes time for me to rearrange my curriculum toward small pieces of a topic that we can *fail at* before we dive in so I still haven't embraced this as much as I'd like.

I also spent my first couple years while creating Python Morsels thinking in terms of forward motion.
I would recommend an exercise, you'd attempt it, reflect on my solutions and find out new techniques and tools you didn't know about or you hadn't thought to use, and then you were done with the problem... never to see it again.
That last bit of reflection was helpful, but it didn't stick nearly as effectively as it *could* have.

That learning reflection contained useful information.
But we don't learn by reading, right.
It's not putting the information *in* that's most important.
For the sake of memory, it's practicing *retrieval* that matters most.

Revisiting the same exercise a few days later, a few weeks later, or a few months later would have allowed for the opportunity to practice *recall*.
But that's not how Python Morsels was setup.
Revisiting wasn't part of the plan.

My students always wanted to move onto the next topic and I usually do too.
That urge to move onto the next thing does us a disservice when it comes to effective learning.

---

I still wish I taught differently.

I don't embrace interleaved practice as much as I'd like.
Text books tend to teach one topic, and then another, and then another.
Most curriculum works the same way.

TODO more on that

I also know that spaced repetition is incredibly effective... think of flash cards as an example.
Short sessions of practicing active recall, spaced out over days and weeks.
Very few learning systems embrace this learning technique and Python Morsels isn't currently one of them.

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

**Cognitive dissonance**

- Cognitive dissonance is discomfort that occurs when we find that our brain contains conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes.
- Cognitive dissonance can be quite acute when you realize that your values and your actions are misaligned.

Years ago, I organized a group called the San Diego Hacker News meetup.
I originally joined the group years before I was the organizer.
The original organizer moved to the Bay Area, and then the next one moved to the Bay Area, and then the next one did.
So eventually I became the organizer.
I was not going to move to the Bay Area.

But at some point I stopped regularly reading Hacker News.
Partly I didn't have the time and partly I felt that the comments on Hacker News were too often contentious.
I found much of the discussions on Hacker News were overly aggressive and mostly unconstructive.

**cesspool** (shown on the screen while talking about Hacker News comments)

After months of running a meetup for an online space that I didn't care about anymore, I experienced enough cognitive dissonance to change my actions.
I ended the group.

Honestly, that was a pretty mild case of cognitive dissonance.
I felt that didn't really want to support Hacker News, but I also didn't care that much.
Mostly I found myself doing something I was no longer interested in.

---

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.
- I stopped running the Hacker News meetup because it felt inconsistent with my beliefs about it
- I believe software maintainability is important and I also think clever and succinct coding solutions are better than less clever and verbose ones. I reconcile these two beliefs by also thinking that we should focus on hiring software developers who are "smart" enough to understand the clever solutions.
- Code maintainability is paramount. And yet we cut corners when writing tests.
- "Diverse teams are more effective". You just recommended your company hire your friend who has a very similar background to you.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty trade-off, but often it's *not* so obvious... at least not at first.


As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

---

Years later, I experienced much more acute cognitive dissonance.

In 2020 I listened to some podcast interviews that started me down a path of questioning some of my actions and beliefs.

I realized that had and still have a few related mental models in my head that are both incomplete and inconsistent.

I love eating all the types of meat....


Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

---

Admitting you were wrong with small things is important.

---

--I don't believe in free will.--

Well... maybe.

I know that I don't believe in a very strong form of free will.

Was it someone's fault that they grew up an an environment that made it increasingly likely that they would be a certain way?

Fault, ownership, responsibility... these are all social constructs.
It's my understanding that we're all just that take actions because a number of things in the past caused the present to happen.

But just because something is a social construct doesn't mean it's not real.

This slide is deliberately blank because I don't want to put shine a light on any one person or event in particular...

When harm happens, 

Danya Ruttenberg has written about apologies and making amends for wrong-doing.

Acknowledge Wrongdoing: Clearly state what you did wrong without explaining away your actions.
Express Remorse: Sincerely express regret for the harm caused.
Make Amends: Take concrete steps to make things right, as best you can.
Commit to Do Better: Demonstrate a commitment avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.
Seek Forgiveness: Request forgiveness, understanding that forgiveness may take a long time or never come.

(Maybe I open with this as a sort of cold open?)

I'm about to lie to you.

Variables act like buckets that contain.

[image of bucket]

When we assign a variable to a list, it contains that list.

When we assign another variable to that first one, the list is copied into a new bucket.

Which is why when we change the first list, the second list doesn't change.

Except that's all wrong.
That second list *did* change.

Something's gone wrong.

This **mental model** of Python's variables and objects is wrong.

---

Let's try another mental model...

Variables are like sticky notes.

[image of post-in note]

When we assign a variable to a list, we put a sticky note on that list which notes to the variable name we've used.

When we assign another variable to the first one, we place *another* sticky note on the same list object.

This mental model is a *lot* better.

But it doesn't seem *quite* right to me.

This list has objects *inside* it which can also be referenced, not currently by variable names, but by list indexes.
So maybe we should place a sticky note on each of those objects that includes the name of the list and the index we're storing that object at.

This **mental model** of Python's variables and objects is a lot better... but it does have its limits.

---

Let's make a list-of-lists.

TODO show lists

What does this look like in our model of sticky notes placed on objects?

Well, we have our outer list which has a sticky note which contains its variable name.
Then we have the 3 inner list objects which each have a sticky note that contains the name of that outer list and the index within that list.
And we have the 6 strings inside those inner lists that each have a sticky note on them which notes the name of the outer list, the outer index, and their inner index.

What would it look like if we pointed a new variable to the same list as our old variable?

Do all of these objects need an additional sticky on them to note on them to note the new name for the outer list?

That doesn't seem quite right.

---

Let's try one more mental model...

Objects are stored in object land and each object has a numeric ID that describes where it lives in object land.
The ID of an object never changes.

Variables are stored in variable land and every variable stores the ID of the object that it currently points to.
That ID can change through assignment statements and multiple variables can point to the same object ID.

List indexes store the IDs of objects, not the objects themselves.
Attributes on modules, classes, and all other objects store object IDs.
Anywhere that an object seems to *contain* another object, instead that object simply contains an ID that points to where an object lives.

[Show arrows pointing between variable land and object land and object land back to itself]

This mental model of Python's variables is a bit more complex than the sticky note model, but it stretches a bit further.

It's arguably a bit closer to how Python *actually* models variables and objects itself.

I took a computational statistics class in college and found it extremely difficult.
The two things I remember from that class are the phrase "Markov chain" and the this quote that was written on chalk board one day:

**Markov Chains?**

> All models are wrong, but some models are useful. -- George E. P. Box

Mental models are wonderful for anchoring your understanding of some small piece of the world within a metaphor.
But not every mental models will improve our ability to reason about the world.

TODO more...?

> All models are wrong, but some models are useful. -- George E. P. Box

We could extend this quote in various ways:

> Some useful models are more useful than other useful models.

> Some models are more useful than another for some purposes bet less useful for other purposes.

(Quantum and Newtonian physics?)

> Some models are less complete but simpler and to work with because edge cases are rare.

Code of Conduct work group relations:

- I didn't intend that
- I did say/do that, but look at what they said/did

Text communication is a low bandwidth medium. It's often challenging to convey our intended meaning and to understand someone's intended meaning through written words than it is by sitting face-to-face.

I can't say this for sure, but I suspect that many issues that are presented to code of conduct teams wouldn't be CoC issues if at least some of the parties involved put in the effort to sincerely understand and appreciate the harm that was caused and attempt to make ammends.

You don't really need to believe in free will or the ownership of one's actions to sincerely apologize. Acknowledging harm, expressing empathy, and signaling a desire to change your future actions for the better all fit pretty nicely into a world little to no free will.
