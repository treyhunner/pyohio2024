## Intro

The point: to help you grapple with the fact that your brian is both an *amazing thing* and it's *constantly making mistakes*.

## Confirmation Bias

Availability Bias? Shark attacks.

A bit similar to the anchoring bias in some ways.

---

Attribution Bias?

---

Halo Effect? A well-designed website leads us to assume that the products are good...? Attractiveness and intelligence.

---

Ostrich Effect? 

---

Purposely incurring technical debt. It requires slowing down your thinking. It requires deliberacy.

---

Overconfidence Bias

Also called the Dunning-Kruger Effect

We *all* experience an overconfidence bias... it's a natural part of gaining expertise.

TODO Example of airplane pilot crashes and the increase after N hours until M hours

When you're brand new, you know that you don't know enough. When you're very experienced, you much better at actually knowing things. But there's a point during learning where we tend to "know enough to be dangerous", meaning we don't know *nothing* but we think we're more skilled than we are.

It is extremely difficult to *notice* our *own* overconfidence without some sort of outside input.

According to Dunning, one of the best ways to overcome *your* overconfidence bias is to team up with others who might be able to notice *your* overconfidence.

For abilities that are quantifiable, like your typing accuracy, you might be able to take a test.
But for abilities that are hard to quantify, like professional skills and social skills, you'll need to seek input from other people... as many as you can.

While making this talk, I *knew* that it wasn't where I wanted it be.
I rehearsed, revised, and wrote down advice I received from over a dozen people.
It's still the talk I'd like to be giving you today, I *have* made a lot of progress, which is a topic I'll talk about in a bit.

CONFIRMATION BIAS

I'm using a regular expression to normalize some text. No matter how I write it, the text doesn't seem to change.

Assumptions worth trying to invalidate:

- Or more fundamentially, the function I've written is actually being called
- The text being passed to this function is the text I think it is
- That regular expression pattern matches what I think it matches
- The substitution function does what I think it does

Need help questioning your assumptions?
Talk to a duck.
Rubber duck debugging gives us someone to talk to when we don't have someone to talk to.
Walk through your code with the duck.
Or imagine what the duck might ask you if it could talk.
Since we live in 2024, I'd also seriously consider talking to a robot.
Claude, Chat GPT, Gemini, or one of the dozens of other large language models that can pretend to be a human trying to help you question your beliefs and assumptions instead of trying to confirm them.

Action Bias

Action is not always better than inaction.

Chesterton's fence is a principle related to the action bias.

---

Also related to Chesterton's Fence, is the overconfidence bias and the related Dunning-Kruger effect.

## Mental Models

We often think of mental models are as something we consciously form, but some mental models are unconscious...

---

PHANTOM MENTAL MODELS

Show the 4 g's (g3, g4, g1, g2) and ask which one is correct.

Exposure versus experience or expertise

I've seen one of these g's many times, but it never caught my attention

The devil's in the g-tails

---

What are the mental models you have about...

- Python
- Economics
- US politics
- What gender is
- Yourself

---

## Progress

---

Getting uncomfortable is often the only way to change the status quo.

---

The past is immutable, but the future isn't.

You can't change what's been done.

You *can* affect the actions you haven't *yet* taken.

---

Deliberately acting differently today than you did yesterday.

Progress requires change and progress is nothing to be ashamed of.

---

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

If you adopt a growth mindset, you believe that through directed effort, you can and you will improve your skills: that your skills aren't fixed but are expandable. If you put in the right effort, you will grow.

The interesting thing about the growth mindset, is that...

You're more likely to learn if you adopt a growth mindset: you're more likely to grow your skills if you believe in your ability to do so.

This isn't some sort of magical thinking where you will something into existence simply be believing it to be true.

Instead, this is focusing on *removing* a barrier that our brains sometimes put up.

If you see yourself as fixed and unchanging, you're less likely to improve your skills.

TODO I have one more cognitive bias I'd like to note before I wrap up... (end of history illusion)

REFLECTION for the sake of progress

Reference Dunning-Kruger effect when talking about progress...

Asking for honest feedback from others isn't easy... in fact, it's often really anxiety-inducing. But it can be *really* helpful in identifying where you need to change

It's so hard to pretend to be objective about *yourself* and your own abilities.

I gathered actionable feedback from over a dozen people on this talk. It was both painful and helpful.

It could be very broad and general: How could I be doing what I'm doing better?

But sometimes more specific ask can be easier to address...

Or, when it comes to asking feedback on Python Morsels or on my curriculum: what didn't work well for you? Where did you get suck or confused and how did you manage to get unstuck, if you did?

Or when watching a video or reading an article I've written: what didn't make sense? where did you get lost?

Outside input can also help disconfirm your assumptions... I sometimes ask my customers to walk me through how they use Python Morsels and I often find that they are *not* using it the way I thought they were.

Melanie said: talk more about how I do this and why I do it... because I know that I don't know what I'm doing as well as I *think* I do...

---

Actionability...

Is it measurable?
Is it actionable?

---

There are times when giving up makes sense.

---

Related to the growth mindset. It's a lot easier for change and growth to occur if you think that you *can* change and grow.

(borrow this from my mentoring talk)

- TODO notes from Michael
  - Someone tried to accomplish something there.
  - Sometimes the fence isn't what it was intended to do. Question why things are the way they are. Don't assume that something is as it should be, but also don't assume that it has no purpose.

Let's say you're a big believer in free market capitalism.

It's your understanding that markets are the most effective mechanism for allocating resources.

What could your mental model be missing?

Well, we all know the issue with fossil fuels and climate change.

Burning fossil fuels has a cost that *isn't* incurred by the *user* of fossil fuels.

This is called a "negative externality".

An externality is an economic cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.

Many free market lovers might agree that this is a situation where carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, or other programs make sense.

The market is *failing* to effectively allocating resources, so taxes make sense in this situation.

But notice I said an externality is an economic cost **or benefit**... there are also *positive* externalities.

For example when someone get vaccinated, they benefit those *around them* in addition to themselves.

When people get an education, the increase in their abilities and their skills benefits *other people* in society.

Should the government subsidize positive externalities? After all, this is a type of market failing too, isn't it?

Of course I'm not an economist, but I have read some things economists have written.

What do your mental models look like?

What does your mental model of economics look like?
What about immigration?
Foreign policy?

You vote based on all of these issues. But you probably have a pretty fuzzy mental model of them. I know I do.

---

Let's say you have strong feelings about immigration in the US.

You have *some sort* of mental model around the US's immigration system... certainly much of this mental model is implicit and there are certainly gaps and inconsistencies in it.
