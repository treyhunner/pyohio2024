We often think of mental models are as something we consciously form, but some mental models are unconscious...

---

Patterns are great

Shortcuts are great

Heuristics are great

Our brains love patterns, mostly because we love shortcuts and patterns help us more effectively take shortcuts.

And our brain is pretty adept at taking the *right* shortcuts *most* of the time.

But all shortcuts are prone to systematic errors

Cognitive Biases

Cognitive Biases were invented by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972.
They're the reason we think funny.

Or at least, they're the ones that coined that phrase.

There are lots of common cognitive biases that occasionally cause us to make errors in judgement.


---

Confirmation Bias

[Googling "What is Python the best programming language?"]

---

Anchoring Bias

When Steve Jobs' announced the price of the iPad, he displayed $999 on the screen for many seconds before eventually announcing that the price would be $499.
That made the iPad seem inexpensive when it was announced.

This doesn't just apply to prices though.
If I generate a random number, and then ask you to guess the percentage of countries that are in the UN, you'll be more likely to guess a higher percentage when the random number was higher.

---

Availability Bias? Shark attacks.

A bit similar to the anchoring bias in some ways.

---

Attribution Bias?

---

Halo Effect? A well-designed website leads us to assume that the products are good...? Attractiveness and intelligence.

---

Ostrich Effect? 

---

Note that we can't possible overcome all of our cognitive biases at all times. Most of life involves mental shortcuts.

In Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman talks about System 1 and System 2... which, speaking of naming things, are awful names. I'm not going to use those terms because they're so confusing.

Instead I'll summarize his work, by saying that...

Fast thinking involves fast mental work that appears nearly effortless

Slow thinking in effortful and involves slow and deliberate mental work

Slow thinking requires more energy and time than fast thinking and we can't possibly use slow thinking for all of our actions.

Fast thinking *is* necessary, though it is also the cause of many of our cognitive biases.

---

A lot of my brain machinery is pretty similar to yours.
Sometimes our unconscious mental models have patterns

---

The past is immutable, but the future isn't.

You can't change the actions you've already taken.

You *can* affect the actions you haven't *yet* taken.

---

Deliberately acting differently today than you did yesterday.

Our brains are constantly changing, whether we like it or not. We may as well embrace that change and try to steer it in a positive direction for ourselves and for everyone else.

Progress requires change and progress is nothing to be ashamed of.

---

Our lives span decades, not centuries.

Life is short.

Enjoy the time you're given.

Try to effect positive change as much as you can.

---

A mental model of the world that depends on humans having a considerable amount of free will.

Is that accurate though?

And does it matter?

I think it does.

If every action we take is entirely taken thanks to free will, then every success or mistake that an individual makes is theirs alone. "You get what you deserve."

If instead, our genetics, our childhood environment, and countless other factors shape our actions then that ownership doesn't as much sense anymore. "TODO?"

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

---

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

---

System 1 and System 2

Fast thinking

Slow thinking

---

Purposely incurring technical debt. It requires slowing down your thinking. It requires deliberacy.

---

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.
- I stopped running the Hacker News meetup because it felt inconsistent with my beliefs about it
- I believe software maintainability is important and I also think clever and succinct coding solutions are better than less clever and verbose ones. I reconcile these two beliefs by also thinking that we should focus on hiring software developers who are "smart" enough to understand the clever solutions.
- Code maintainability is paramount. And yet we cut corners when writing tests.
- "Diverse teams are more effective". You just recommended your company hire your friend who has a very similar background to you.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty clear cut trade-off, but often the balance is *not* so obvious... at least not at first.

As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

---

Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

---

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

---

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

---

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

---

Admitting you were wrong with small things is important.

---

This slide is deliberately blank because I don't want to put shine a light on any one person or event in particular...

When harm happens, 

Danya Ruttenberg has written about apologies and making amends for wrong-doing.

Acknowledge Wrongdoing: Clearly state what you did wrong without explaining away your actions.
Express Remorse: Sincerely express regret for the harm caused.
Make Amends: Take concrete steps to make things right, as best you can.
Commit to Do Better: Demonstrate a commitment avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.
Seek Forgiveness: Request forgiveness, understanding that forgiveness may take a long time or never come.

---

Your models of the world are always a work-in-progress. Accept that and embrace it.

When a more useful model comes along, try it on.

Then play catch up.
You need to change your mind before you change your actions.

---

TODO Do chairs exist?

There is no objective experience of reality.

Our brains are simply modeling the world.

TODO a few quick facts on why/how this is the case...

---

Things you can improve:

your mental model of the various social constructs around us:

- Python
- Economics: markets and incentives
    - What are markets and competition good at?
    - What are the downsides to markets?
    - When/where do people's incentives align and where do they misalign?
    - What are positive and negative externalities?
- Politics
    - What are the likely consequences of a new law?
    - What are the likely consequences
- Gender
    - How do different societies perceive gender today?
    - How has the role of gender changed throughout history?
    - What purpose has gender served evolutionarily?
    - What purpose does gender serve today?
- Sexuality
- Religion
- Free will: including blame-worthiness, praise-worthiness and how much of a role luck plays in the specific outcomes over an individual's lifetime
- Self: do individual humans exist?
- Ontology: does anything exist?
- Empathy
    - TODO

300 years from now, which of my actions will look absurd?

Which of my actions will look immoral or naive?

---

We mostly experience the world from a first-person perspective.

Attempting to seek out or model a third-person perspective can be very helpful when seeking a resolution to a conflict.

Taking on a second-person perspective is the hardest, that is thinking from the perspective of the person you're directly interacting with. Empathy.

---

So in summary:

- Admit that you have a human brain
- Give your beliefs names and shapes
    - Naming things: give important ideas names
    - Mental models: make your mental models explicit
- Iterate, accepting discomfort
- Think outside yourself
    - Modeling your thinking 
    - There are levels to this
- Note opportunities for improvement

- Hold your identity lightly? - Julia Galef


---

I'm going to talk about:

- Naming Things
- Mental Models
- Iterating on Your Beliefs
- Cognitive Dissonance
- Admitting Your Flaws

That third idea might be a little uncomfortable, but it's the last two ideas that where I'll be hoping you don't throw vegetables at me.

Tonight:

Add actual code and [TODO imagine a bucket image]


Notes from Melanie:

Consider changing the language of my students from people that come to me to learn Python

Melanie thinks I should mention and screenshot my spreadsheet of suffering and mention that I'm a nerd

Let's look at some pictures of cute animals to cleanse our pallat (sad chicken)... oh wait that wasn't the right one... here's an actually happy animal

Change the Python oddity example because it's confusing


---

You said something in a code review that your coworker was offended by.

How did they experience what you said as offensive?
What were you feeling when you said that?
Why did you feel that?
Why did you say what you did?
Was there another way you *could* have said what you did?

This sort of deliberate reflection takes energy and time.
It can also be emotionally taxing.

The goal isn't to do this for every negative interaction we have... the goal is to help us recognize a pattern so that we can occasionally slow down and act more deliberately until our new thinking patterns and actions become our new habit.

I teach Python to groups through team trainings and to individuals through Python Morsels.

I know that
