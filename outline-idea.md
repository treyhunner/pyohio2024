We often think of mental models are as something we consciously form, but some mental models are unconscious...

---

Availability Bias? Shark attacks.

A bit similar to the anchoring bias in some ways.

---

Attribution Bias?

---

Halo Effect? A well-designed website leads us to assume that the products are good...? Attractiveness and intelligence.

---

Ostrich Effect? 

---

The past is immutable, but the future isn't.

You can't change the actions you've already taken.

You *can* affect the actions you haven't *yet* taken.

---

Deliberately acting differently today than you did yesterday.

Our brains are constantly changing, whether we like it or not. We may as well embrace that change and try to steer it in a positive direction for ourselves and for everyone else.

Progress requires change and progress is nothing to be ashamed of.

---

Our lives span decades, not centuries.

Life is short.

Enjoy the time you're given.

Try to effect positive change as much as you can.

---

Extending grace (?) to those around us can be helpful.
Then again, you shouldn't let unchecked harm run amok.
Rules, laws, and codes of conduct exist for the purpose of harm reduction and good feeling maximizing (???)

---

It's hard to admit to myself that I could be doing something better than I am... especially hard when I'm making either no progress or very slow progress at improving in that particular area.
It also feels embarrassing to admit that I'm not doing as well as I could be and I probably never will.
Hopefully I'll improve, but it's never going to be as much as I'd like.

---

Purposely incurring technical debt. It requires slowing down your thinking. It requires deliberacy.

---

Examples in Python, programming, etc.?

- Code of conduct violation: what I'm being accused of is a bad thing, but I'm a good person.

Nothing in black and white. There's always a trade-off. Sometimes it's a pretty clear cut trade-off, but often the balance is *not* so obvious... at least not at first.

As humans, we tend to get very wrapped up in our sense of self.
Our egos are a big part of how we experience existence.

Making a conscious effort to think about and talk through your own actions as if you were another person can be really helpful for temporarily suspending our egos.

---

Who has attempted to meditate before?
Who has found meditating challenging because the thinking just keeps happening?

Sometimes meditation teachers will say that you shouldn't try to stop thoughts from happening.
Just let them happen.
Observe the thought and acknowledge it and it will eventually be on its way.

That's a little bit similar to the way I try to handle cognitive dissonance.
One idea 

- I have been experiencing cognitive dissonance 

A bit of a warning: you may have a feeling of cognitive dissonance over3

---

Admit your failings to yourself.

Admit your failings to others.

It's especially hard when you haven't yet and may never move through a particular failing.

Saying "I failed", "I learned from it", and "now I'm better for it" isn't so hard.
In fact, it can feel empowering.

Saying "I failed" and "I'm still failing"... that's hard.

Our brains like to defend us.
When we act inconsistently with our own values, we prefer not to think too hard about that fact.

> That didn't happen.
> Okay, but it wasn't bad.
> Well, it wasn't *very* bad.
> Besides, it wasn't my fault.
> And if it was, that wasn't my intention.
> And regardless, my actions were justified.

- An adaptation of "The Narcissist's Prayer"

---

I'm a good person.
I wouldn't do that because it would be wrong, which would mean *I'm* wrong.
I wouldn't do that because it would be bad, which would mean *I'm* bad.

---

It's hard not to get wrapped up in your own self of `self`

Who are you?

Are you a good person or a bad person?

Are you think kind of person who would `____`?

Our identities are part of us.

---

As Julia Galef said in The Scout Mindset, thinking like a "scout" means holding your identity lightly.

It's not easy to avoid...

Identifying with the code we write

Identifying with the actions we perform

Identifying with the actions we *want to* perform

---

TODO I am speaking as a cisgender straight white man with pretty good self-esteem who doesn't currently suffer from depression.

Our brains all have a limit at which we no longer are able to feel good about ourselves.

--I did a bad thing, so I'm a bad person.--

I'm a good person, so I don't do bad things... at least not *too* bad.

I did enough bad things and they were bad enough, that I must be a bad person.

---

What are the mental models you have about...

- Python
- Economics
- US politics
- What gender is
- Yourself

---

300 years from now, which of my actions will look absurd?

Which of my actions will look immoral or naive?

---

We mostly experience the world from a first-person perspective.

Attempting to seek out or model a third-person perspective can be very helpful when seeking a resolution to a conflict.

Taking on a second-person perspective is the hardest, that is thinking from the perspective of the person you're directly interacting with. Empathy.

---

So in summary:

- Admit that you have a human brain
- Give your beliefs names and shapes
    - Naming things: give important ideas names
    - Mental models: make your mental models explicit
- Iterate, accepting discomfort
- Think outside yourself
    - Modeling your thinking 
    - There are levels to this
- Note opportunities for improvement

- Hold your identity lightly? - Julia Galef


---

I'm going to talk about:

- Naming Things
- Mental Models
- Iterating on Your Beliefs
- Cognitive Dissonance
- Admitting Your Flaws

That third idea might be a little uncomfortable, but it's the last two ideas that where I'll be hoping you don't throw vegetables at me.


---

You said something in a code review that your coworker was offended by.

How did they experience what you said as offensive?
What were you feeling when you said that?
Why did you feel that?
Why did you say what you did?
Was there another way you *could* have said what you did?

This sort of deliberate reflection takes energy and time.
It can also be emotionally taxing.

The goal isn't to do this for every negative interaction we have... the goal is to help us recognize a pattern so that we can occasionally slow down and act more deliberately until our new thinking patterns and actions become our new habit.

---

I teach Python to groups through team trainings and to individuals through Python Morsels.

I know that 


---

Our brains are very concerned with our perception of ourselves.

Am I smart?

Do I belong?

Am I good?

---

--Cognitive dissonance--

This is partly why cognitive dissonance can be so hard to grapple with.

When my actions don't align with what I think is good or correct, I feel unsettled.

---

Move vegan section out of default states, after progress, and after discomfort, to talk specifically about cognitive dissonance as a form of discomfort that I continue to sit with.

---

A more real world example with the words and phrases we use.

"Light years" are *not* a measure of time

"Organic food" is a weird phrase because inorganic food doesn't exist. (a metal apple)

A "Calorie" in nutrition and a "calorie" in chemistry are not the same thing... but in a frustrating way.
1 capital-C "Calorie" is equal to 1,000 lowercase-c "calories".

"Biannually": twice each year or once every 2 years?

When I read "4 ounces"... are we talking about volume or weight?

"Serverless"... this word can mean a lot of things, but it rarely means "without a server"

"Theory of Relativity"
Once a theory becomes broadly accepted, it doesn't become a fact... it just stays in "theory" land forever.
The proper functioning of GPS satellites heavily depends of this so-called theory.

"Literally".
I literally do not understand what happened to this word.

"guys"

Discomfort

Deliberate

Don't get me wrong...

I'm not advocating for discomfort for its own sake.

Don't stick your hand in a bucket of ice water for no good reason.

But TODO need a good analogy that involves slowing down and doing something a bit uncomfortable for the benefit of the whole and maybe even for our own benefit...?


---

The point: to help you grapple with the fact that your brian is both an *amazing thing* and it's *constantly making mistakes*.

---

I think of System 1 as not just faster-thinking but also more implicit.

I think of System 2 as more explicit because it's a bit slower and more deliberate.

The Zen of Python says:
Explicit is better than implicit

So is System 2 *better* than System 1?
No, but also yes.

It's more powerful, but it's slower and it takes more energy.
Changing our conditioning to slow down and step into System 2 takes hard work... and that work isn't always worth it.

---

When my someone tells me "what you did hurt me", I feel two competing emotions.

I feel:

- Empathy: I know what being feels like
- Defensive: my actions and myself are being judged

My actions are being judged and I am being judged.

TODO my defensiveness is often stronger, especially when the hurt that was caused or my own sense of agency are big

- It's mid-February 2020
- I had just finished a client training that involved me traveling through an airport full of international travelers and we were in a global pandemic and I was experiencing a mix of ignorance and denial about the state of my world
- After I traveled home for what I, didn't know at the time, would be my last flight of 2020... I listened to a podcast episode that had me thinking about morality and ethics
- After listening to that episode, and as the US was starting to lock down due to COVID-19, I started listening to an audiobook by the guest of that podcast episode
- This book had me considering very odd lines of thinking... at least odd for me at the time
    - I wondered whether I needed to donate much of my money to be a good person
    - and whether I have a moral obligation to donate one of my kidneys?
    - and whether my way of living was causing undue suffering in the world...
- I'd like to note... that I love food and I am a *somewhat* adventurous eater
- ...

Getting uncomfortable is often the only way to change the status quo.

Overconfidence Bias

Also called the Dunning-Kruger Effect

We *all* experience an overconfidence bias... it's a natural part of gaining expertise.

TODO Example of airplane pilot crashes and the increase after N hours until M hours

When you're brand new, you know that you don't know enough. When you're very experienced, you much better at actually knowing things. But there's a point during learning where we tend to "know enough to be dangerous", meaning we don't know *nothing* but we think we're more skilled than we are.

It is extremely difficult to *notice* our *own* overconfidence without some sort of outside input.

According to Dunning, one of the best ways to overcome *your* overconfidence bias is to team up with others who might be able to notice *your* overconfidence.

For abilities that are quantifiable, like your typing accuracy, you might be able to take a test.
But for abilities that are hard to quantify, like professional skills and social skills, you'll need to seek input from other people... as many as you can.

While making this talk, I *knew* that it wasn't where I wanted it be.
I rehearsed, revised, and wrote down advice I received from over a dozen people.
It's still the talk I'd like to be giving you today, I *have* made a lot of progress, which is a topic I'll talk about in a bit.

---

Where is your attention?

When learning something new, we often remember better when we take a guess and *then* reveal the answer.
Why? No one really knows, but "surprise" is a pretty good guess.
When we're surprised our brain pays more attention.

Early humans that paid to paid attention to surprises may have been less likely to be killed by predators.

Focus.
Ask questions.
Be curious.
Develop habits.
Seek advice.
Introspect.

These are all ways to catch our attention. Catching the attention of our brain is the first step toward progress.

Once an idea has your attention, you'll mull it over.
And thinking *about* an idea is the first step toward being able to *act* on that idea.

---

Show the 4 g's (g3, g4, g1, g2) and ask which one is correct.

Exposure versus experience or expertise

I've seen one of these g's many times, but it never caught my attention

The devil's in the g-tails

---

Your brain doesn't directly experience the world around you

Your brain is constantly *modeling* the world

And it does so... flawlessly

Not flawlessly... flawfully

Falafely?

Fluffily.

Nevermind that thought...

What I'm trying to say is that words matter

The wordsweuseandconsumeaffectourthoughts

The models your brain makes have...

flies

floss

flaws
